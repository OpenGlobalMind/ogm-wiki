# Thriving in Our Cyborg Future

Our future is Cyborg. 

That means we will meld more and more with software. 

If you're awesome at Excel, PowerPoint, or PhotoShop, you've had a taste of it — and may have a head start. 

The alternative is us being replaced completely by software. 

In Freestyle Chess, human+AI teams beat either one alone. 

Work will be like that. 

It's hard to know what frontiers GenAI will shatter next. 

It's possible to internalize GenAI deeply. 

Doing so requires several kinds of trust. 

Orchestrating individual Cyborgs to play together well will pay off even better. 

They will create powerful collective intelligence. 

Organizations that do so will have unfair advantages. 

Creating a workplace that can achieve this requires planning and principles.
