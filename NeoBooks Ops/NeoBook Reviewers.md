# NeoBook Reviewers

Thank you so much for offering to help create the first NeoBook!

You can review Klaus's current draft [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t8jppx3sqvjxs9mRHJA-FQbsyZUVmJu0/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115193236884506869693&rtpof=true&sd=true). 

At this point, we're not doing line edits or anything that detailed. We'd like to know, does this read like a book, and if not, what would make it so? Are there gaps in the logic or narrative? Are elements missing altogether? Does the text read well? 

We're meeting Mondays at 10:30am PT in [my Zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/4154650256?pwd=Zm5DWGRJcmFmZGtBMmI1Wkx2WUQyZz09), if you want to join. Our Mattermost channel is [here](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-sensedoing). 

And [[NeoBooks Introduction|this page]] describes NeoBooks, so you can grok the thing we're aiming for.
