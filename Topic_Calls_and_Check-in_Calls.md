# Topic Calls and Check-in Calls

On a check-in call, we go around the room in turn, with each person doing a "check-in" of how they're doing or what's going on for them. We join the queue by raising our Zoom hand, and Jerry calls on us in order.Â   
  
When we're doing check-ins, we hold conversation or replies until everyone has had their opportunity to check in. That may not happen before our 90 minutes are up; we may not even get to every person.  
  
If we're doing it well, the person who's about to speak will take a little time to be in silence before speaking; slowing down a bit helps keep us from overheating.  
  
OGM calls alternate between "topic" calls (conversation on a particular topic), and check-in calls, in alternating weeks.
