it's interesting to think about how -- and indeed, even whether to, or at least, when -- pages centralize when you have massive numbers of participants.  Take a page like "Peter Kaminski" -- should all the versions of that page scattered around different decentralized wikis centralize towards one page in the aggregation wikis?  will there be "namespaces" for people (like a /peterkaminski/ or /ogm/ or /cicolab/ top-level directory)?  perhaps  a massive wiki viewer would resolve one link name like "Peter Kaminski" into a multiplicity of destinations (/peterkaminski/Peter Kaminski, /ogm/Peter Kaminski, *and* /cicolab/Peter Kaminski)?
