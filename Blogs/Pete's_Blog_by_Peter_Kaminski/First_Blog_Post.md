## OGM Wiki
First blog post in OGM Wiki, first blog post in a Massive Wiki!  Starting a blog in this wiki is a one of the [[Great Weird Ideas]].

Now we need a "blog viewer" that sorts pages reverse chronologically, and puts the last 5-10 on one page. :-)

(Our regular tools will work okay for a while, of course.)

I set up a Doodle for this week's OGM Wiki call: https://doodle.com/poll/9g5ukhqh5zxssyev

Agenda:

-   20 minutes on Massive Wiki Starter Guidebook (pre-release version)
-   10 minutes transition time / check-ins
-   30 minutes on OGM Wiki content, organization, purpose

I started the [[OGM Community Patterns]] page with the "Coalescing a New Community" pattern I've noticed a couple of times.

## Massive Wiki
 I got about half done with a first draft of "[Massive Wiki Starter Guidebook](https://github.com/Massive-Wiki/massive-sandbox/tree/main/Massive%20Wiki%20Starter%20Guidebook)".  See the "0. Style Guide for Massive Wiki Starter Guidebook" page for more details.  [[People/Bill Anderson]] has made some improvements, and we'll whip it more into shape this week.

## FJB
Some good conversation around [[Massive Wiki]] and [[Visual Jam]].  Maybe we'll have some Visual Jam calls soon!

## Stewardship Council
Jerry and Judy and I had a good session improving the OGM-Lionsberg MoU draft, using HackMD connected to the stewards wiki.  That wiki and HackMD are working reasonably well.
