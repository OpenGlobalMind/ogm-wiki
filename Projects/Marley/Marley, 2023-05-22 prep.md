## Optional Homework for 5/22

_I assembled these in the hope that they'd be useful input to our QFB Intent and Vision session. Consider reviewing these before the 5/22 meeting as prep. Thank you! -- Pete_

- [[Vision and Intent Template 1]] - a generic template
- [[QFB Vision-Intent Starter A]] - start of a possible Vision-Intent statement, don't take it too seriously, this is mostly just something to react to, let's discuss broadly about Vision and Intent
- [[Ideas to Consider for QFB Vision and Intent Process]] - many candidate good/bad ideas to think about
- [[QFB Sample New Member Onboarding Questionnaire]] - consider where you are in the process of working on QFB
