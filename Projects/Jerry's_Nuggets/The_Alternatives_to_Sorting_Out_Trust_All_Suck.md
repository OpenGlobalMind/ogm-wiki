# The Alternatives to Sorting Out Trust All Suck
 (draft) 
*Subhed.* 

I haven't found a rigorous, exhaustive ([MECE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECE_principle)) framework that encompasses all the futures we might face, but the futures on offer today do seem bleak. For example: 

[New Optimists](https://bra.in/8jXrV2) tell us to worry less: Things are better! While I agree that mortality rates, poverty and other statistics have improved, I can't help but believe that the default path we're on takes us into autocratic surveillance societies, with new intelligences emerging that will be motivated by consumerism instead of social good, plus a high likelihood of self-inflicted, traumatic climate disruptions, all while trust continues to crack. 

[Tech Utopians](https://bra.in/5jLadN) are also optimistic: Tech will fix it! Look at the cool things in the [Fourth Industrial Revolution](https://bra.in/2q5QrK)! Alas, I fear tech has helped bring about many of the problems I'm talking about here, and the people guiding tech have usually pursued efficiency, scale and profit — even when it means hacking our easily addicted brains — over building a [convivial](https://bra.in/6pKr4B) world. Generative AI absolutely has the potential to help us design a better world, but only if we solve for the many trust issues it kicks up. 

In 2021, Mark Zuckerberg [gave us his vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvufun6xer8) of living in the Metaverse, which he believed in strongly enough to rename Facebook to Meta and ~~waste~~ invest many billions. It's worth noting here that Zuckerberg is the unelected, unsupervised sovereign of a virtual "nation" larger than the populations of India and China combined (3.9 billion monthly average users of Meta's services, vs roughly 2.9 billion). 

Unfortunately, Zuckerberg's vision would have looked familiar to anyone tooling around in [Second Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life) in 2003, and likely less social or novel than that pioneering service. Worse, though, is the idea that we'll love donning immersive goggles for our social interactions. 

The "[trustless](https://bra.in/8pKg6B)" crypto vision seems alarmingly naïve: We're going to bid up smart-contract initiatives anonymously, [using crypto tokens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqhAqRO1YEY), and that's going to add up to a desirable, well-oiled society? Do you trust how "facts" were added to the shared ledger? Do you trust that nobody's violating the principles that make blockchains work? And don't you actually want to know and meet the people who share your community? 

Finally, the [broligarchs](https://bra.in/7j8XRk) who say "[we have to get off this rock!](https://bra.in/3vAB8a)" seem oblivious that trust is essential to becoming a multiplanetary species. Without trust, you don't want to be on the first thousand cramped rockets full of settlers. Besides, there's plenty to do to heal our lovely planet.
