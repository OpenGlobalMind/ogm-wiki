# DARVO

[DARVO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO) is the worst-named, most important concept in the domain of relationships in the last couple decades. It stands for **D**eny the abuse, then **A**ttack the victim for attempting to make them accountable for their offense, thereby **R**eversing **V**ictim and **O**ffender. 

Doesn't roll off the tongue, does it? It also doesn't store easily in long-term memory. But it'll make sense with a brief explanation. 

## Deny

The first step, when accused, is to deny everything. 

Never met [that woman](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/grtXPwqt9EM). Never been to [Epstein's Island](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DNng20_IknY). Know nothing about [Project 2025](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yKAb545E2rQ). Never said "[Lock her up.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/V8_8xmDlM6A)" The list is interminable. 

Now, President Clinton also [denied things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH_7Zfdqx48), but he was Junior Varsity in comparison. He was playing semantic tricks to avoid responsibility for his bad behavior, then got pinned to the wall by evidence.

>And yet, in another echo of the 1850s, MAGA Republicans are reversing victim and offender, blaming the people under assault for the violence. Trump officials insist that community watch groups and protesters are engaging in “domestic terrorism.” — Letters from an American, [Jan. 31, 2026](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/january-31-2026)
