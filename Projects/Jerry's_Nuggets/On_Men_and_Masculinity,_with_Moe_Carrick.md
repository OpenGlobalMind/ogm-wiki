# On Men and Masculinity, with Moe Carrick 
 
*What's happening to masculinity?* 

I'm focusing the [Rethink the Future podcast](https://rethinkconstraints.substack.com/podcast) on ways of co-creating a better future. These days, it seems that my use of "co-creating" will remain wishful thinking unless we address what's been happening to boys and men. So let's start that conversation. 

[Moe Carrick](https://bra.in/8jkoVZ) has been helping organizations improve their teams and culture for some time, writing three books on the subject along the way. We met recently, at the [Responsive](https://www.responsiveconference.com/) conference in Oakland. 

A longtime TEDx licensee and motive power behind TEDxBend, Moe gave a talk at TEDxSalem that sparked this podcast conversation. It's titled [Loving Men: Rethinking Women’s Role in Defining Masculinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7KVrxjkmic). 

Moe and I let our conversation range freely, so we could bring different facets of the dynamics for boys and men into focus and see how they influence one another. Here's the episode:
