# US Businesses Have Given Workers Good Reasons to Mistrust Them 
 (draft) 
*Workers seem to have gotten the raw deal for years.*  

It's not easy to be calm in today's US workforce. 

Workers have good reason to suspect that Management is trying to get rid of them or squeeze them dry, from 

Here's a roughly chronological list of why: 

- US worker's real wages have barely risen since 1971 (the [Productivity-Pay Gap](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/) and the [Great Decoupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoupling_of_wages_from_productivity)), while profits have skyrocketed and executive compensation has exploded. 
- In 1981, Reagan's first act was to [break PATCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_Professional_Air_Traffic_Controllers_Organization_strike), the Air Traffic Controller's union. It got worse for unions after that. 
- [Corporate Raiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_raid) gutted pension funds in the 1980s, leaving many workers with no retirement savings.
- In the 1990s, [Reengineering](https://hbr.org/1990/07/reengineering-work-dont-automate-obliterate/ar/1), [Outsourcing](https://bra.in/6pDNkr) and [Offshoring](https://bra.in/3p7GXM) left many Americans unemployed, often forcing them to train their replacements. 
- [Globalization](https://bra.in/4qVJEJ) was great for prices, bad for US workers. 
- Policy makers [replaced](https://bra.in/6j45Qg) "Citizens" with "Consumers," thus changing policy goals. 
- No US Government, Democratic or Republican, moved to protect workers. 
- Part-time work (where employers aren't liable for benefits) is replacing full-time. 
- Worse, part-time workers face [Zero-Hour Contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-hour_contract) (no paid hours guaranteed) to [On-Call Worker Scheduling](https://bra.in/9vGyb9) (no pre-set schedule, so you can't take a second job). 
- Universities have been shifting to [Contingent Faculty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjunct_professor), while bloating administrative expenses and amenities. 
- Life in the modern Gig Economy, often seen as a life raft, is very [precarious](https://bra.in/7jLJ4N).

This is some of the evidence of how [[The Social Contract Is Broken]].
