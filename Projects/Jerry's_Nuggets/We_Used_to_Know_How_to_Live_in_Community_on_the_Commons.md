# We Used to Know How to Live in Community, on the Commons 
 (draft) 
My, how we've grown! \</irony>\

Too many people are convinced that life used to be nasty, brutish, and short. Our lifespans were short, the narrative goes. Violence was everywhere, with humans barely staying alive on a hostile landscape. Then "civilization" saved us, starting with agriculture, which forced us to stay put. 

I no longer believe that story. Over the years, many different thinkers have convinced me that in many places — not everywhere — humans knew how to take care of the landscape and they knew how to take care of one another. We knew how to live in community, on the Commons (which I always capitalize, out of respect, like "Internet," oddly enough). 

This was the starting assumption of [[My Story of Trust]]. 

## Hard-won wisdom 

Knowing how to live in community, on the Commons, wasn't innate for humans: it was hard-won wisdom. We did manage to kill ourselves off, time after time. We wiped out megafauna, overgrazed, chopped down handy forests, overfished, and in other ways made it hard to stay alive. We saw famines and epidemics. We also attacked one another pretty consistently, with lethality increasing as weapons improved and forms of social organization allowed for larger armies. 

Living in harmony with the land and one another takes patience, effort and wisdom. The core principles of many indigenous traditions around the world revolve around stewardship and community. These include:

Of these, Ubuntu has become popular enough to be almost cliché. More notably, several more of these concepts comprise entire belief systems:

A comprehensive cultural code that governs all aspects of life, emphasizing communal harmony, respect for elders, reciprocal obligations, and collective responsibility.    |

Much of this wisdom predates writing. It was passed down through generations in rituals, oral traditions, cultural practices, apprenticeships and other means. Some of it is deeply tied to language and country, in ways that make it hard — if not impossible — to capture and pass on through traditional Western forms of communication, such as this post. 

Some of the more accessible insights that have stuck with me include: 

- The cultures I'm citing were more concerned with stewardship than ownership. 
- Many managed their landscapes collectively over time, as opposed to private plots for commerce and private consumption. 
- They did their best to bring bad actors back into their communities. Ostracism and death were actions of last resort. They favored counsel over cancel. 

## Coming full circle 

Alas, Colonialism did its level best to ignore, suppress, or destroy all that hard-won wisdom. 

Now we're struggling with these very issues: We've lost our sense of community and we've despoiled our many Commons. And we wrack our brains about how it could have happened. 

As if this struggle weren't complicated enough, it is compounded by the swift, recent rise of Generative AI. 

How might we win back what we once knew? Not turn back the clock, but rather blend the best of the old with the best of the new. That's the hopeful quest I'm on. 

Recent books offer us great clues, including:
