# Wikipedia Started as the Nupedia
 (draft) 
*On redesign from trust.*

[Design from Trust](https://www.designfromtrust.com/) isn't a tweak, it's a rethink. Systems that are designed from trust are different enough from the systems they replace to be surprising. Wikipedia makes a great, familiar example. 

Wikipedia wasn't always a Wiki. It started life innocently enough in 2000 as the Nupedia, the brainchild of Jimmy Wales, who wanted to create a free online encyclopedia for the world's benefit. 

Jimmy hired Larry Sanger and the two went about the very ambitious project of writing an encyclopedia the way a publisher might: they recruited volunteer editors and assigned them to their domains of expertise (think German, geography, biology, tech, economics, art...). Then they instituted a seven-step editorial process to ensure each article's quality. 

Progress was slow. After some 18 months, they had published fewer than 20 articles. Production of a whole encyclopedia seemed out of reach. 

As the Nupedia struggled to birth reliable articles, Wales and Sanger learned about Wikis, which the programmer Ward Cunningham had invented in 1994 so he and his colleagues would have a quick, HyperCard-inspired way to build websites rich with internal links. A pioneer of [Pattern Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language) in software, Ward's first substantial Wiki was the [Portland Pattern Repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Pattern_Repository). 

Wikis are pretty simple. They save every version of every page created, which makes correcting mistakes (or vandalism) straightforward: revert to the previous saved page. They also allow participants to track changes on pages they care about, so they can see (and possibly revert) changes that matter. Making links between pages is super simple; linking to things on the Web is easy, too. There's no editorial process, though on Wikipedia, over time, norms emerged, then got codified. There are no titles (like Editor in Chief) or turfs, which encourages open participation. 

Wales told his editors they had started one such Wiki and named it Wikipedia, not expecting much. From that point on, the Wikipedia story became notable online history. 

A question I ask audiences all the time is, "Who has used Wikipedia in the last few months?" Predictably, most of the hands in the room go up. Then I ask, "Who remembers the moment they figured out how Wikipedia works?" That often elicits chuckles and gasps of recognition.
