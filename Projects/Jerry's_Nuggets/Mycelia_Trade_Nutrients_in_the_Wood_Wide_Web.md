# Mycelia Trade Nutrients in the Wood Wide Web

Because [[Mycelia Externalize Their Digestion]], breaking down things like minerals that other organisms can't access, they exchange those minerals (and other things) for sugars that they can't create, since they don't have chlorophyll or do photosynthesis. 

All this happens at the root (rhyzomal) level, hence the coining of the "Wood Wide Web". 

This [[Fabulous Fungal Metaphors|fungal metaphor]] helps explain our fondness for the metaphor of [[The Big Fungus]].
