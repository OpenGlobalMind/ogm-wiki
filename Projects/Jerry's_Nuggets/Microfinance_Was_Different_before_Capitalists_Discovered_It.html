      <h1>Microfinance Was Different before Capitalists Discovered It</h1>
<p>In 2007, when my better half and I first met, she was doing microfinance law. I had heard of microfinance, but was only superficially familiar with it.</p>
<p>I think I knew that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus">Muhammad Yunus</a> won the Nobel Prize for it (the Peace prize, not for Economics) and how microloans work. I also understood that microlending violates a basic rule of banking: you must have collateral in order to give a loan. There has to be something you can take and sell if the borrower fails to repay.</p>
<p>Yunus didn't invent lending circles. They predate him, and have been known as cestas in Latin America and by <a href="https://blog.wetrust.io/roscas-around-the-world-70c68d5e040">many other names</a> around the world. Yunus brought them attention, and for a while, that was terrific. Many of the world's poor got access to funds that helped them bootstrap out of their situations.</p>
<p>Counterintuitively, microloan default rates are lower than traditional loans. That may be because they were usually lending <em>circles</em>, not individuals. The members of each circle are highly motivated to help one another repay; that's how they get to use the funds, and how they improve their own credit record.</p>
<p>Then the major financial centers got wind of microfinance's successes, and eventually got enthusiastic. Money poured in. And as the money mounted, problems multiplied:</p>
<ul>
<li>The circles broke, and increasingly microloans went to individuals</li>
<li>Countries couldn't track who had a loan, so individuals applied for many</li>
<li>Some borrowers got in trouble</li>
<li>Lenders learned that complementary training and services were important</li>
</ul>
<p>Then some markets got saturated, with some borrowers taking multiple microloans, one to pay off the other, unable to close the loop. Some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035259/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-12-28/suicides-among-borrowers-in-india-show-how-men-made-a-mess-of-microcredit">committed suicide</a>.</p>
<p>Our current flavor of Capitalism doesn't like mutual aid. It doesn't like leaving anything on the table for others. It doesn't like equity, community or waiting especially long.</p>
