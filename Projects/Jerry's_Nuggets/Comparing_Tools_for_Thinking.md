# Comparing Tools for Thinking

The [[Tools for Thinking]] space is broad and fuzzy. Its boundaries are indistinct. You can see a map of the territory here. 

After [[Defining Tools for Thinking]], we're experimenting with ways of comparing the tools in the sector. 

One fruitful experiment is using Spider or Radar Charts. To do that, we generated a list of factors or dimensions, such as visualization, use of machine learning, composability and openness. Then we rated each tool across all the dimensions. You can see the results in this chart. Use the filters to turn tools on and off. 



Please let us know if you have a different way of comparing these tools.
