# How a Betterverse Might Improve Disciplines

Our vision of a better Metaverse, [[The Betterverse]], motivates the sharing of information across disciplines in ways that are rare today. This page plays these collaborations out, across the disciplines of:

- Education
- Science
- [[Effects on Journalism|Journalism]]
- Politics
- Governance

Key to understanding the Betterverse is the idea of [[The Big Fungus]], which is our name for the growing collection of information, opinions and media, which are all interconnected the way mycelial filaments (called hyphae) make connections in healthy soil.

Participants in the Betterverse make a practice of adding their documents to The Big Fungus, where their contributions are available to others, just as Wikipedia pages are available to anyone in the world who consults that encyclopedia. 

### A Journey

Imagine a student, Anna, who wants to understand how masking policies worked and didn't work during the Covid Pandemic. She finds a study headed by an epidemiologist, Bernice, who used [open lab notebooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science) and followed [[Open Science Protocols]], which means that much more information is available to the public than the simple published research papers of old. 

So it's relatively easy for Anna to get familiar with Bernice's research, and then to test it with a few questions of her own. 

Meanwhile, a reporter named Carlos is digging into a story assignment about masking policies. 

While each of them work, they share out what they find, constructing a powerful shared memory. 




How different from just blogging. 
What does The Big Fungus do better? New value it creates?
