# On Men and Masculinity, with Moe Carrick 
 
*What happened to masculinity?* 

I'm focusing the Rethink the Future podcast on ways of co-creating a better future. What's happening to boys and men in the US may not be the first thing you think of for improving the world, but it sure lurks loudly in the background, as you'll see from this conversation. 

[Moe Carrick](https://bra.in/8jkoVZ) has been helping organizations improve their teams and culture for some time, writing three books on the subject along the way. We met recently, at the [Responsive](https://www.responsiveconference.com/) conference in Oakland. 

A longtime TEDx licensee and motive power behind TEDxBend, Moe gave a talk at TEDxSalem that sparked this podcast conversation. It's titled [Loving Men: Rethinking Women’s Role in Defining Masculinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7KVrxjkmic). 

Moe and I let this conversation range freely, so we could bring different facets of the dynamics for boys and men into focus and see how they influence one another. Here's the episode:
