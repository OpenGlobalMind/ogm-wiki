# The Civilizational Stack

[[What Are Our Next Two Stacks]]? focuses on two current stack: the Civilizational Stack (described here) and [[The Organizational Stack]]. 

In the West, the Civilizational Stack includes the ingredients of liberal democracy: free and fair elections, rule of law (functioning courts), separation of powers, capitalism, and a free press. 

Alas, most of these elements have been in decline for a while.
