# History of Design Thinking 
(from Gemini, 2025-11-29)

That's a very insightful connection! You are **partially correct** in linking Design Thinking to **Human-Centered Design (HCD)** and the concept of **Empathic Design**, as they are all deeply intertwined and contributed significantly to the modern, mainstream framework of Design Thinking.

However, the history of Design Thinking is a broader, longer evolution that began decades before Dorothy Leonard and Jeffrey Rayport published their 1997 article on Empathic Design.

Here is a description and illustration of the history of Design Thinking, placing Human-Centered Design and Empathic Design within that timeline.

## 🕰️ A Brief History of Design Thinking

Design Thinking, as a methodology for creative problem-solving, has roots that stretch back to the mid-20th century, primarily evolving in academic research before being codified and popularized by design consultancies.

### 1. Early Academic Roots (1950s–1970s)

The foundation was laid by academics studying the design process itself:

- **John E. Arnold (1959):** A professor at Stanford, he is one of the first credited with using the term **"design thinking"** in his book _Creative Engineering_, emphasizing a creative approach to problem-solving.
    
- **L. Bruce Archer (1960s):** A British mechanical engineer who championed design research and helped establish design as an academic discipline. He wrote about the **"Systematic Method for Designers"** (1963-64).
    
- **Herbert A. Simon (1969):** The Nobel laureate positioned design as a **"way of thinking"** in _The Sciences of the Artificial_, stressing concepts like **rapid prototyping** and observation—principles central to Design Thinking today.
    
- **Horst Rittel & Melvin Webber (Early 1970s):** Introduced the concept of **"Wicked Problems"**—complex, ill-defined problems with no clear-cut solution—highlighting the inadequacy of traditional, linear scientific methods and suggesting the need for an iterative, participatory approach.
    

### 2. The Rise of Human-Centered Design (HCD)

The core principle that a design process should start with the people you're designing for solidified in the 1970s and 1980s. **Human-Centered Design (HCD)** is a broad philosophy and framework that underpins modern Design Thinking.

- **Human-Centered Design (HCD):** A design approach that puts **human needs, capabilities, and behavior** at the center of the development process. It seeks to design products and systems that are usable and useful by focusing on the end-user. The emphasis is on deep user research and involving the user throughout the design and testing phases.
    

### 3. Empathic Design as a Key Methodology

**Empathic Design**, introduced by **Dorothy Leonard and Jeffrey Rayport** in a 1997 _Harvard Business Review_ article, is a specific set of techniques within the larger HCD philosophy.

- **Empathic Design:** This technique focuses on gaining a **deep, empathic understanding** of customer needs, especially _latent needs_—those customers themselves may not recognize or articulate. Its foundation is **observation**—watching consumers use products/services in the context of their **own environment** (in the field), rather than relying only on traditional market research like surveys or focus groups.
    
- The emphasis on **deep empathy** as the foundational step in understanding the problem space is a direct and powerful precursor to the "Empathize" stage in the modern Design Thinking process.
    

### 4. Codification and Mainstreaming (1990s–2000s)

The academic concepts and HCD/Empathic Design principles were synthesized, codified, and popularized for the business world by design consultancies:

- **IDEO (David Kelley and Tim Brown):** Kelley, who studied under Arnold at Stanford, co-founded IDEO in 1991. IDEO is largely credited with taking the academic ideas and practical HCD principles, packaging them into the **clear, actionable, iterative framework** known today as **Design Thinking** (often articulated as the 5-stage process: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test).
    
- **Stanford d.school (2005):** David Kelley co-founded the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford, which heavily promoted and taught this five-stage process, solidifying Design Thinking's role as an innovation methodology.
    

### 💡 Key Takeaway

Design Thinking is not _derived solely_ from Empathic Design, but rather **Human-Centered Design** is the broad umbrella that covers the foundational principles (including Empathy). Empathic Design is a **critical set of methods** that contributed directly to the first, and arguably most important, stage of the modern Design Thinking process—**Empathize**.

Would you like me to elaborate on the **five stages** of the modern Design Thinking process (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test)?
