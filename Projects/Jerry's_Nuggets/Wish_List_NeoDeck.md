# Wish List: NeoDeck  
(draft) 
*Presentations are just playlists!*

[[NeoDecks are Mushrooms of The Big Fungus]]. 

[[PowerPoints Should be Playlists]] 

More practically, NeoDecks are playlists of composable, reusable Nuggets that live on individual wiki pages. Creating a NeoDeck means understanding [[Nuggetization]], then plotting a course through Nuggets you want to include. Your presentation is the playlist you create. 

To create presentations, we'll need a slide-sorter view that lets us see what is where, and also lets us grab subsets of our presentation and move them around. 

This is one of several [[ATproto Apps]] I would love to see exist, which are on my [[Software Wish List]].
