# Kayfabe, OODA, DARVO: Why Democrats Are Clueless
 (draft) 
*The US Left and media don't know what hit them.*  

I'm deeply concerned for the American Left. I'm afraid it has little clue what game is afoot. Progressives keep bringing knives to gunfights. 

Actually, that's the wrong analogy, because it seems to suggest that Lefties need to up the violence to win. tktktk

I'm going to be blunt and political in this post, tktktk. 

For me, the most memorable example of Democratic cluelessness happened during the 2016 Election cycle, in Hilary Clinton's debates with Donald Trump. Clinton studied the issues and showed up to win debates. Trump did not.

owned the media cycle for some three days. 
showed his followers he understood modern power.

Please suspend your disbelief for a moment while I explain.

## Mix and match

Of course, 

The OODA Loop is a strategy you can use for good or evil. Kayfabe is a shared fiction. DARVO is very definitely a betrayal of trust. 

Except if you're in on the joke.

How the sausage gets made. 

This post just scratches the surface of what's needed for a rethought Democratic party to reemerge.
