# Kayfabe, OODA, DARVO: Why Democrats Are Clueless
 (draft) 
*The US Left and media don't know what hit them.*  

I'm deeply concerned for the American Left. I'm afraid it has little clue what game is afoot. Progressives keep bringing knives to gunfights. 

Actually, that's the wrong analogy. tktktk

The most glaring and memorable example of Democratic cluelessness I can think of is Hilary Clinton's debates with Donald Trump during the 2016 Election cycle. Clinton studied the issues and showed up to win debates. Trump didn't. 

I'm guessing Trump knows he's likely to lose any legitimate debate against an Ivy-League trained opponent. So instead, he 

owned the media cycle for some three days. 
showed his followers he understood modern power. 

In 2024, Joe Biden showed up for a debate; Donald Trump showed up for a [cage match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types#Steel_cage_match). Democrats had learned nothing at all. 

## Three concepts worth knowing

Three concepts will help me explain this: Kayfabe, OODA and DARVO. I'm afraid most Lefties are unfamiliar with these terms, and the increasingly powerful Far Right is familiar with at least two of them — as they commit the third. Please suspend your disbelief for a moment while I explain. 

[[Kayfabe]] 

[[OODA]] 

[[DARVO]] 

## Mix and match

Of course, 
## Trump's Playbook 

Trump's favorite tactics. 

The OODA Loop is a strategy you can use for good or evil, but Keyfabe and DARVO are very definitely betrayals of trust. 

Except if you're in on the joke. 

## Going meta 

How the sausage gets made. 

I posted these six videos in 2020.
