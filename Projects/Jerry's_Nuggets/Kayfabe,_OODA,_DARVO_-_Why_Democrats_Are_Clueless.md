# Kayfabe, OODA, DARVO: Why Democrats Are Clueless
 (draft) 
*The US Left doesn't know what hit them.*  

Despite signs of life in the Democratic party from a few victories in the November 2025 elections, I'm still deeply concerned for the American Left. I'm afraid it has no clue what game is afoot. Lefties keep bringing knives to gunfights. 

Three concepts will help me explain this: Kayfabe, OODA and DARVO. I'm afraid most Lefties are unfamiliar with these terms, and the increasingly powerful Far Right is familiar with at least two of them — as they commit the third. Allow me to explain.
