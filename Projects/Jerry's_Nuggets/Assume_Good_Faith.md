# Assume Good Faith

This is one of the [[Principles of Design from Trust]]. In fact, it's the first one. 

It's also a foundational principle of [Open Source](https://opensource.org/blog/assume-good-faith) software, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith), and the Internet — all of which are fab examples of [[Design from Trust]]. 

While considering Assume Good Faith (or intent) can get one feeling overly optimistic, considering its opposite is sobering. Assuming Bad Faith is a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. It creates a downward spiral. 

It's this assumption that just about anyone could be a bad actor that has given us the dysfunctional institutions we're trying to shed now. 

Valid objections: 

- But isn't this naïve? See [[Not Naïve Trust]].
- What about when you hit real bad actors? Won't you get hurt? See [[Be Undefended, Not Defenseless]].
