## Topics

### Jerry's Brain Concept

- 27-year-old mind map with ~600,000 entries
- Used for personal knowledge management and sense-making
- Handcrafted connections between ideas, no AI automation
- Accessible publicly at bra.in/jerry
- Potential for broader applications in collaborative knowledge-building

### New Stacks for Civilization/Organizations

- Concept of "stacks" applied to societal/organizational structures
- Current Western "civilizational stack": democracy, capitalism, free press, rule of law
- Current "organizational stack": for-profit corps, non-profits, emerging alternative models
- Need to design new models resistant to corruption/takeover
- Examples: sociocracy, holocracy, wirearchy as emerging alternatives

### Global Renegotiation of Social Contracts

- Observation of widespread social uprisings/unrest globally
- Involuntary renegotiation happening due to dissatisfaction with current systems
- Institutions failing to adapt, creating openings for radical change
- Need for new models of collaboration and decision-making at all scales

### Current U.S. Political Situation

- Discussed as potential "coup" or institutional breakdown
- Concerns about dismantling of agencies like USAID without clear alternatives 
- Lack of understanding of cascading effects on global health, security, etc. 
- Parallels drawn to historical coups and regime changes 

### Designing New Governance/Collaboration Platforms

- Interest in platforms that allow large-scale democratic participation 
- Examples: vTaiwan, Polis in Taiwan as potential models 
- Need for systems resistant to takeover/corruption 
- Importance of building trust and abundance rather than scarcity 

### Studying Historical Transitions

- Interest in examining post-WWII institutional design process 
- Arab Spring discussed as case study in failed transitions 
- Importance of having "platforms" ready for governance transitions
