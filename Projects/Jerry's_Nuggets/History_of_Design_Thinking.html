      <h1>History of Design Thinking</h1>
<p>(from Gemini, 2025-11-29)</p>
<p>That's a very insightful connection! You are <strong>partially correct</strong> in linking Design Thinking to <strong>Human-Centered Design (HCD)</strong> and the concept of <strong>Empathic Design</strong>, as they are all deeply intertwined and contributed significantly to the modern, mainstream framework of Design Thinking.</p>
<p>However, the history of Design Thinking is a broader, longer evolution that began decades before Dorothy Leonard and Jeffrey Rayport published their 1997 article on Empathic Design.</p>
<p>Here is a description and illustration of the history of Design Thinking, placing Human-Centered Design and Empathic Design within that timeline.</p>
<hr />
<h2>🕰️ A Brief History of Design Thinking</h2>
<p>Design Thinking, as a methodology for creative problem-solving, has roots that stretch back to the mid-20th century, primarily evolving in academic research before being codified and popularized by design consultancies.</p>
<h3>1. Early Academic Roots (1950s–1970s)</h3>
<p>The foundation was laid by academics studying the design process itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>John E. Arnold (1959):</strong> A professor at Stanford, he is one of the first credited with using the term <strong>"design thinking"</strong> in his book <em>Creative Engineering</em>, emphasizing a creative approach to problem-solving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>L. Bruce Archer (1960s):</strong> A British mechanical engineer who championed design research and helped establish design as an academic discipline. He wrote about the <strong>"Systematic Method for Designers"</strong> (1963-64).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Herbert A. Simon (1969):</strong> The Nobel laureate positioned design as a <strong>"way of thinking"</strong> in <em>The Sciences of the Artificial</em>, stressing concepts like <strong>rapid prototyping</strong> and observation—principles central to Design Thinking today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Horst Rittel &amp; Melvin Webber (Early 1970s):</strong> Introduced the concept of <strong>"Wicked Problems"</strong>—complex, ill-defined problems with no clear-cut solution—highlighting the inadequacy of traditional, linear scientific methods and suggesting the need for an iterative, participatory approach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. The Rise of Human-Centered Design (HCD)</h3>
<p>The core principle that a design process should start with the people you're designing for solidified in the 1970s and 1980s. <strong>Human-Centered Design (HCD)</strong> is a broad philosophy and framework that underpins modern Design Thinking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Human-Centered Design (HCD):</strong> A design approach that puts <strong>human needs, capabilities, and behavior</strong> at the center of the development process. It seeks to design products and systems that are usable and useful by focusing on the end-user. The emphasis is on deep user research and involving the user throughout the design and testing phases.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Empathic Design as a Key Methodology</h3>
<p><strong>Empathic Design</strong>, introduced by <strong>Dorothy Leonard and Jeffrey Rayport</strong> in a 1997 <em>Harvard Business Review</em> article, is a specific set of techniques within the larger HCD philosophy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Empathic Design:</strong> This technique focuses on gaining a <strong>deep, empathic understanding</strong> of customer needs, especially <em>latent needs</em>—those customers themselves may not recognize or articulate. Its foundation is <strong>observation</strong>—watching consumers use products/services in the context of their <strong>own environment</strong> (in the field), rather than relying only on traditional market research like surveys or focus groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The emphasis on <strong>deep empathy</strong> as the foundational step in understanding the problem space is a direct and powerful precursor to the "Empathize" stage in the modern Design Thinking process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Codification and Mainstreaming (1990s–2000s)</h3>
<p>The academic concepts and HCD/Empathic Design principles were synthesized, codified, and popularized for the business world by design consultancies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>IDEO (David Kelley and Tim Brown):</strong> Kelley, who studied under Arnold at Stanford, co-founded IDEO in 1991. IDEO is largely credited with taking the academic ideas and practical HCD principles, packaging them into the <strong>clear, actionable, iterative framework</strong> known today as <strong>Design Thinking</strong> (often articulated as the 5-stage process: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stanford d.school (2005):</strong> David Kelley co-founded the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford, which heavily promoted and taught this five-stage process, solidifying Design Thinking's role as an innovation methodology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>💡 Key Takeaway</h3>
<p>Design Thinking is not <em>derived solely</em> from Empathic Design, but rather <strong>Human-Centered Design</strong> is the broad umbrella that covers the foundational principles (including Empathy). Empathic Design is a <strong>critical set of methods</strong> that contributed directly to the first, and arguably most important, stage of the modern Design Thinking process—<strong>Empathize</strong>.</p>
