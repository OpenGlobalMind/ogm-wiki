# The Metaverse Is a Lousy Vision for Humanity's Future

I've written elsewhere about the Metaverse's flaws, but I'd like to summarize them here .

Your list may be longer, but my problems with the Metaverse include :

- social isolation 
- resource consumption 
- technology mediating reality 
- invasions of privacy

Alas, neither the Metaverse nor Apple's [[Spatial Computing]] vision, nor any combination of those two that I can imagine, describes a world that sounds beneficial for humans.
