# Designing a Better Future Together
 (draft) 
*Through Design from Trust.* 

What do the following have in common? 
- The Internet 
- [Horse whispering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_horsemanship) 
- [Traffic calming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_calming) 
- [Microfinance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance) 
- [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.com) 
- [Workplace democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_democracy) 
- [Unschooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling) 
- [Unconferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) and the
- [Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System) 

They all share a particular dependence on trust. 

Somewhere around 2012, it dawned on me that many of my longtime role models and inspirations — the people who innovated the various systems I just listed (and [many more](https://bra.in/4pxQ56)) — had several profound things in common. 

First, I realized that many (most?) of my role models were contrarians. Each of the contrarians was carrying a message difficult enough for their peers to hear that they were often marginalized or ridiculed by their peers. Their insights ran against their discipline's standing conventional wisdom: Give people with no collateral loans? No way! Let any fool on the planet edit the Wikipedia? Are you nuts? Remove traffic lights? Seriously? Let any worker stop the assembly line? We'll never get anything built! 

You see what I mean. 

Then, slowly, I discovered the thread that connected their initiatives, which I called Design from Trust (and abbreviate as DfT). 

Any system that has more than two humans in it involves trust, which has countless facets. The facet I'm focusing on with DfT isn't building high-trust teams, or using transparency to increase trust, or revealing and fixing defects in a system to raise long-term trust. Instead, I've been fascinated by this more specific take on trust that has to do with systems design. 
 
What's crazy about Design from Trust is that redesigning systems with it then affects many of the other facets that I just stepped past. For example, empowering everyone to stop the assembly line builds high-trust teams and improves product quality. Hosting Unconferences (instead of programming every moment of an event with famous speakers and fancy panels) is a gesture of trust to your participants. Adopting Open Source software or Workplace Democracy directly increases transparency and trust. 

**The tl;dr:** Design from Trust redesigns systems from an assumption that most people who will touch the system are good actors. They want to enjoy the system's benefits, and may even wish to help improve it. 

Instead of designing systems as if everyone is a bad actor, DfT flips the script, and deals with the bad actors later. 

Instead of designing out all risks, DfT lets some risks engage participants and inspire them to contribute significantly to the systems' healthy functioning. If pedestrians, bicyclists and drivers don't slow down, make eye contact, and pace-match through intersections, Traffic Calming fails. If nobody steps forward at an Unconference and names a topic for conversation, there won't be any sessions. 

Leaving some risk in the system leaves some responsibility for the system's success in participants' hands.

## History 

Believe it or not, my catalyst for these insights was the single word "[consumer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VfeuITmNUk)." 

[Somehow](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/projects/jerry's_nuggets/my_story_of_trust), over the past multiple decades (and centuries), we lost faith in humans. Then we designed all our institutions as if everyone was a bad actor. 

What's worse, we adapted, we got used to it. We take mistrust completely for granted now. We've normalized it so well that mistrust is the default setting and we're startled when that setting switches. 

This wasn't always so. Long ago, we figured out [[We Used to Know How to Live in Community on the Commons|how to live in community, on the Commons]]. It was hard-won wisdom, and we've forgotten most of it. 

## Reality 

Whoa, whoa, whoa!, I hear your brain say: has Jerry read the news? It seems trust is in tatters these days. 

People around the world seem hungrier for change than for trust. 

Not naïve trust. 

Reality check. 

Consider the benefits of leveraging authentic trust, now. 

## Benefits 

But trust:
- Is [[Trust Is Cheaper Than Control|cheaper than control]]  
- Builds community 
- Unlocks genius 
- Begets [abundance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlo8d7F5hdo&feature=youtu.be) 
- Differentiates you (especially in low-trust times)
- Feels great (even when it's scary) 

It's also fragile. And [[Trust is…|more]]. 

Covering all these angles would turn this post into a paper or a book, so I'll be writing posts about them all, plus the many other issues I'm just touching on here. Follow or subscribe if you'd like to join the journey. 

## How

Designing from ([[From Trust, Not For|not for]]) trust requires thoughtful (re)design — and a "mirror." You can't just bolt DfT on existing systems and expect it to work.

## Outcomes 

Questions DfT addresses: 

- How might we break the grip of addictive social media and surveillance capitalism? 
- How might we rebuilt trust and retake control over the design of our cities and institutions? 
- 

Lovely ideas spill out when you flip the trust telescope, such as [[Scarcity = Abundance - Trust]] and [[The Joy Line]]. Well, and Design from Trust 😁. 

[[Trust Is the (Only) Way Forward|Trust is the (only) way forward]]. We have an opportunity to redesign everything from trust. 

If we do this right, we might collectively construct a [Betterverse](https://www.thebetterverse.org/).
