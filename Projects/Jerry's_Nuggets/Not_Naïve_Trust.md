# Not Naïve Trust
 (draft) 
*We're not all trustworthy, but we're definitely not all bad actors.* 

In simpler times, when we lived in villages and didn't travel much from them, we grew up knowing whom to trust and not to trust. A few lucky people still live in villages like that, but for most humans, those times are long past, and as a result, we've had to figure out how to deal with strangers. 

It turns out that over many, many years we — a complicated, collective, multi-layered we, crusty with history — started designing our institutions around the assumption that pretty much everyone might be a bad actor. As a result, we created systems that invite mistrust, disconnect us from responsibility and one another, and have been dragging civilization down. 

[[Design from Trust]] is interesting and needed because it seems we-many took this opposite path. Not Naïve Trust is one of its [[Principles of Design from Trust|core principles]].

Not Naïve Trust pairs nicely with [[Be Undefended, Not Defenseless]] and [[Design from Trust Requires Thoughtful Design]], and [[Trust Is Cheaper Than Control]].
