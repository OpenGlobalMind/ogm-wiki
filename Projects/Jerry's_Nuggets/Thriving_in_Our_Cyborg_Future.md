# Thriving in Our Cyborg Future

Our future is Cyborg. 

That means we will meld more and more with software. 

If you're awesome at Excel, PowerPoint, or PhotoShop, you've had a taste of it — and may have a head start. 

I've been a Cyborg for 28 years, melding with software called TheBrain. That makes me a great case study for our Cyborg future, especially since TheBrain just added generative AI, deeply and powerfully. Now I'm working at the frontier between human curation and GenAI. 

In Freestyle Chess, human+AI teams beat either one alone. 

Work will be like that. 

It's possible to internalize GenAI deeply, melding with it, becoming a Cyborg. 

Orchestrating individual Cyborgs to play together well will pay off even better. 

They will create powerful collective intelligence. 

Organizations that do so will have unfair advantages. 

Being a human amid all this change is difficult. 

It's hard to know what frontiers GenAI will shatter next. 

The alternative to going Cyborg is being replaced completely by software. 

Becoming a Cyborg requires several kinds of trust, from trust in the AI to trust that your employer won't fire you. 

Creating a workplace that can achieve all this requires trust, experimentation, flexibility, planning and principles.
