# Trust Is the (Only) Way Forward (U20 Talk)

In September 2020, I gave a virtual keynote (there was a bit of a Pandemic underway) for the Bucharest-based conference Unfinished 2020. You can watch the full talk [here](https://youtu.be/gf3vp0Wquz8), or see it in context in my Brain, [here](https://bra.in/3qnVD9). 

Two years later, I spoke live in Bucharest at U22, offering the backstory to this talk, as [[A Worldview Built from Contrarians]].  

This is also the title of a [[Trust Is the Only Way Forward (NeoBook)|NeoBook in progress]].
