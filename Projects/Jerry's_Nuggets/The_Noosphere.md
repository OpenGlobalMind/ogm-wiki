# The Noosphere

[The Noosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere) or "sphere of reason" is a philosophical concept analogous to our atmosphere and biosphere, but for ideas. Two thinkers spawned it a century ago: the biogeochemist [Vladimir Vernadsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vernadsky "Vladimir Vernadsky") and the philosopher and [Jesuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus "Society of Jesus") priest [Pierre Teilhard de Chardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin "Pierre Teilhard de Chardin"). 

Where the Noosphere was once wishful thinking, the presence of the Internet since the mid-1990s has sparked many thinkers to try to turn those wishes into reality, including the orgs mapped [here](https://bra.in/8qad6E). 

Our [[Open Global Mind]] organization explores the Noosphere, though we don't use that language much.
