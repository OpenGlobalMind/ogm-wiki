# Running a QFT on Curiosity

Here’s a facilitator-ready explanation of the Right Question Institute’s **Question Formulation Technique (QFT)**—structured so you can _use it directly_ to run a **90-minute Zoom session on the theme “Have we lost our curiosity?”** I’ll give you:

1. **A crisp explanation of QFT**
    
2. **Why it works for conversations about curiosity**
    
3. **A detailed, time-coded 90-minute Zoom agenda**
    
4. **Prompts, scripts, breakout instructions, and debrief questions**
    
5. **Tips for adapting it to your style / JerrysBrain mode**

# **1. What the QFT Is — in Simple, Facilitator-Usable Language**

  

The **Question Formulation Technique (QFT)** is a structured process that helps people **generate**, **improve**, and **strategically use** their own questions. It was developed by the Right Question Institute (Dan Rothstein & Luz Santana) to empower learners, communities, and organizations.

  

QFT has **six steps:**

1. **Question Focus (QFocus)** – A stimulus you give people that sparks questions.
    
2. **Produce Questions** – People generate lots of questions _without discussion, judgment, or answering._
    
3. **Improve Questions** – They label questions as open/closed and practice converting between them.
    
4. **Prioritize Questions** – They choose the questions most important/relevant for a purpose.
    
5. **Plan Next Steps** – They decide what they’ll do with those questions.
    
6. **Reflect** – On what they learned about questioning and about themselves.
    

  

### **What makes QFT unique**

- It **protects raw curiosity** from critique during generation.
    
- It **teaches people HOW to ask questions**, not just _that_ curiosity matters.
    
- It works in any group size, including Zoom.
    
- It creates **psychological safety + intellectual spark** quickly.

# **2. Why QFT Is Perfect for “Have We Lost Our Curiosity?”**

  

Because it:

- Allows people to **experience curiosity**, not just talk about it.
    
- Reveals what people _really_ wonder about when freed from judgment.
    
- Surfaces social and cultural forces that suppress curiosity.
    
- Builds a shared landscape of questions you can map, cluster, or relate to your “Design from Trust” frame.

# **3. A 90-Minute Zoom Agenda (with scripting)**

  

Here’s a ready-to-run flow.

---

## **0:00 – 0:05 — Welcome + Framing**

  

**You say (script):**

“Tonight we’re going to explore a question many of us feel quietly: _Have we lost our curiosity?_ Instead of debating it, we’re going to use a method created by the Right Question Institute called the **Question Formulation Technique**. It gives us a way to surface what our curiosity is actually doing.”

  

Give quick orientation:

“We’ll go through six stages: focus, generate, improve, prioritize, plan, and reflect.”

---

## **0:05 – 0:10 — Introduce the QFocus**

  

Pick ONE QFocus. Options:

  

### **Option A (provocative)**

  

**“Have we lost our curiosity?”**

  

### **Option B (visual)**

  

Show a photo: an adult staring at a phone while a child is exploring something.

  

### **Option C (your work-aligned)**

  

**“Trust grows when curiosity grows.”**

  

Your script:

“This statement isn’t a question. It’s just a stimulus. Your task is to _ask questions about it._ Not to agree or disagree.”

---

## **0:10 – 0:12 — Give the QFT Rules**

  

Share them on screen:

  

**Rules for producing questions:**

1. Ask as many questions as you can
    
2. Do not stop to answer, judge, or explain
    
3. Write down every question exactly as stated
    
4. Change any statements into questions
    

---

## **0:12 – 0:22 — Produce Questions (Breakout Groups)**

  

Put people in **breakouts of 3–4** for 10 minutes.

Each group designates a recorder in the Google Doc / shared board / Zoom chat for their breakout.

  

**Prompt:**

“Ask as many questions as you can about the QFocus. Follow the rules strictly.”

  

What will happen:

- First 2 minutes: shallow questions
    
- Minutes 3–6: real concerns & tensions
    
- Last 2 minutes: surprising meta-questions about curiosity itself
    

---

## **0:22 – 0:32 — Improve Questions (Open/Closed)**

  

Bring everyone back.

  

**Script:**

“Now we’ll practice improving questions. Label each of your questions as **Open** or **Closed**.

- Closed = can be answered with a word or two
    
- Open = require explanation or discussion.”
    

  

Then instruct them to:

- Convert **one closed → open**
    
- Convert **one open → closed**
    

  

Why this matters:

People become aware of how their curiosity _expands or narrows_ depending on question type.

  

Facilitate quick share-outs:

- “What did you notice in the conversion exercise?”
    

  

(Expect people to say: “Changing the form changed how I thought.”)

---

## **0:32 – 0:42 — Prioritize Questions**

  

Give this prioritization goal:

  

**“Select the three questions that feel most important for understanding what is happening to curiosity today.”**

  

Groups discuss & pick three.

Post them publicly (Miro board, Google Sheet, or shared doc).

---

## **0:42 – 1:00 — Whole-Group Discussion: What Are We Seeing?**

  

You cluster or map the questions quickly while they talk.

Great clusters to expect:

- Social forces suppressing curiosity
    
- Education & work
    
- Trust, agency, autonomy
    
- Tech + distraction
    
- Emotional safety
    
- Curiosity as a muscle
    
- Curiosity in community
    

  

Prompts:

- “Where are the questions dense? Where are they thin?”
    
- “What seems unasked?”
    
- “What do these questions tell you about the _state of our curiosity_?”
    
- “What assumptions show up across questions?”
    

  

This is where your “Design from Trust” frame can come in naturally:

You can observe how curiosity grows in safe, trust-based spaces and collapses under surveillance or control.

---

## **1:00 – 1:15 — Next Steps: What Will We Do With These Questions?**

  

In breakouts of 3:

  

Prompt:

“Choose one of your top questions and brainstorm **one action**, however small, that you might take in the next week to explore it.”

  

Examples:

- Ask a child what they’re curious about
    
- Reverse one of your assumptions
    
- Host a curiosity lunch conversation
    
- Practice “asking before telling” at work
    
- Start a ‘question log’ for a day
    

---

## **1:15 – 1:25 — Reflection**

  

Bring everyone back.

  

Ask three reflection questions (QFT’s usual set, adapted for your theme):

1. **What did you learn about asking questions?**
    
2. **What did you learn about your own curiosity?**
    
3. **What did this process reveal about whether we’ve lost curiosity—or where it still lives?**
    

---

## **1:25 – 1:30 — Close**

  

Thank people.

Invite them to share one question in chat they’re leaving with.

Signal that curiosity is an ongoing practice.

  

If you want, you can close with a line like:

“Curiosity is the earliest expression of trust—in ourselves, in others, and in the world.”

---

# **4. Additional Facilitation Tips**

  

### **Keep the QFocus emotionally neutral**

  

(It should provoke questions, not arguments.)

  

### **Keep the question-generation stage** 

### **strictly**

###  **nonjudgmental**

  

The magic happens here: people feel their curiosity coming back to life.

  

### **Use silence strategically**

  

Silence works like oxygen for curiosity.

  

### **If the group is large, use a shared document for real-time visibility**

  

People get energized seeing each other’s questions accumulate.

  

### **Honor even the “wild” or “naive” questions**

  

Those often reveal suppressed curiosity.

  

### **You can integrate your Brain**

  

For example:

After the call, create a node “Have we lost our curiosity?”

Subnodes for question clusters.

Send participants the link.

# **5. If You Want, I Can Also Create…**

- A **slide deck** for this exact 90-minute session
    
- A **facilitator script** you can read verbatim
    
- A **Google Doc template** for the QFT stages
    
- A **follow-up email** you can send participants
    
- A **short video script** introducing QFT + curiosity
    

  

Just tell me which you want.
