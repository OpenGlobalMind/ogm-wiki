# Proposing a GenAI Compact

This is both a project framework and the site for one or three draft articles. 
Working draft is now on Google Docs, [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dOxkUjFfeVhAlGnMkNMx1bpiEXC0i6g6VxLAmgvQTdE/edit). 

Possible draft titles:
- GenAI Anxiety: A Poll 
- Exploring Trust in GenAI Implementation 
- Proposal: A GenAI Compact 

Here are some starting points for each article:
## GenAI Anxiety: A Poll 

No mention of the Compact, just a poll that asks these Pain questions: 
- How much Shadow AI use is going on? 
- Are workers fearful of losing their jobs? 
- How much are they hesitating to help? 

## Exploring Trust in GenAI Implementation 

Poll results and analysis. 

The Pain: 
- How much Shadow AI use is going on? 
- Are workers fearful of losing their jobs? 
- How much are they hesitating to help? 

The Gain: 
- Imagine everyone leaning in to GenAI productivity *and* work reconfiguration 
- 

## Proposal: A GenAI Compact 

Now the Compact description. And website :)

Inspired by: 
- How Mondragon responds to economic contractions
- Longshoremen in the face of containerization in the Bay Area ([this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/06/weekinreview/the-nation-the-100000-longshoreman-a-union-wins-the-global-game.html?unlocked_article_code=1.N04.V2sJ.MuPok9ULPkQ2&smid=url-share) sort of makes my point)
- Germany's Constitution requires labor representation 
- NYT article: [The Robots Are Coming, and Sweden Is Fine](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/business/the-robots-are-coming-and-sweden-is-fine.html?unlocked_article_code=1.N04.K2X_.J1LPUVEpNgLx&smid=url-share) 

Is there a personal Compact, too? 

Huge issues this touches: 
- Labor trust
- Capitalist pressures 

Implementation ideas:
- Tie into other usual constructs, like ESG, PR, 
- What are the guardrails against abuse?
