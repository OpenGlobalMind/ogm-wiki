 *What do we mean by "abundance"?* 

Recent bestseller titled [Abundance](https://www.amazon.com/Abundance-Progress-Takes-Ezra-Klein-ebook/dp/B0C7RLJSQD/jerrymichalskisr), written by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson. 2012 book titled [Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think](http://www.amazon.com/Abundance-Future-Better-Than-Think/dp/1451614217/), by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler. Each means something different by abundance, a series of differences that are really useful to explore.
