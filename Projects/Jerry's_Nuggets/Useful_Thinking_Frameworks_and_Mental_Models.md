# Useful Thinking Frameworks and Mental Models
(draft) 
*A visual resource you can interact with in my outboard Brain.*

If you subscribe to Shane Parrish's [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/) newsletter, you are likely familiar with his fascination with mental models. In fact, in 2019 he started publishing [The Great Mental Models](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P79P8ST/jerrymichalskisr), which now runs four volumes. 

I've been fascinated with ideas and mental models, too, but I collect them in a different way: in my [[Jerry's Brain|Brain]], slowly, building context over time. 

Embed a video here, touching UTF&MM, Design Methodologies, Design Thinking, Critiques of Design Thinking, Participatory Design, back, Decision Making Models, OODA Loop, John Boyd, Brilliant Military Minds, Moltke, Moltke the Elder, No plan, Everyone has a plan, Decision Making Models, Cynefin, Dave Snowden, home, BVSR, Donald Campbell, Campbell's Law, Goodhart's Law, home, Analytic Frameworks, DSRP, TIMN, Theories of Everything, home, Futures Tools and Techniques, Group Process Tools and Techniques, home, Yamas and Niyamas. 

Here's a direct link to [Useful Thinking Frameworks and Mental Models](https://bra.in/8vPM9p) in my Brain. And here's what that map looks like, trapped on this page:

Finally, here's a Brain Tour that follows everything I clicked on in my Brain. You should be able to go off-roading at any point, then get back to the Tour. 

TheBrain software records some metadata, so I know when I added or modified each Thought in my Brain. For example, I didn't create the big collective thought Useful Thinking Frameworks until October 2015, but many of the models now under it predate it. For example, I added the OODA Loop in 2004 and the Cynefin framework in 2008. Russ Ackoff's Idealized Redesign went in way back in 1998, very early in my use of TheBrain. 

This is what happens when [[Knowledge Should Accumulate|knowledge accumulates]], as it is meant to. 

This is also only an example of one person's knowledge accumulating. The process is more powerful when groups do it, but that's challenging at the moment â€” a topic for future posts. 

I'd love to know what models you prefer and what models I've missed, how I might arrange these differently, and what stories you might tell around these items. And if anyone undertakes a systematic comparison of my Brain's links and Shane's books' contents: wow!
