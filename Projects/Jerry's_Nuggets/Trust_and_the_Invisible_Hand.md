# Trust and the Invisible Hand
 (draft) 
*Subhed.* 

Alas, many of our brains have been occupied by a narrative that life is nasty, brutish and short, and that if only we all pursue our greedy self-interest, an invisible hand will guide the larger economy to an equilibrium. That’s all hogwash. 

We are social creatures, born to learn and cooperate. The invisible hand is a convenient fiction, invented to make an unstable system seem more stable. Trust is the catalyst that enables that cooperation. Without collaboration, the system is inherently unstable. Trust is central.
