# How Might We Make a Better Future?
(draft) 
*A quest around a question that likely stirs us all.* 

I love "how might we?" questions, and this is my favorite. 

So much so that I've started a podcast titled [Rethink the Future](https://rethinkconstraints.substack.com/podcast) within my Substack, [Rethink Constraints](https://rethinkconstraints.substack.com/). The Substack has a broader scope, which means it will include critical pieces and more varied material. 

The podcast will focus on how we might make a better future together. It will consist of a blend of interviews, group discussions, talking-head pieces by yours truly and stranger things like #Braindrops.
