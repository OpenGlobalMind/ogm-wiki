# Thanks for Buying This Souvenir

Thank you for buying this souvenir.

That's what a book is now: a souvenir, a memento, a snapshot of a specific collection of ideas at a moment in time. You can get it autographed, you can mark it up, you can make it your own copy (though your ebook will never get that well-loved look of tattered, dog-eared pages and scuffed covers).

Your act of buying this book supports our community. We are grateful.
