      <h1>GenAI Automates Tasks, Not Jobs</h1>
<p>(draft)
<em>But knock away enough tasks...</em></p>
<p><img src="/ogm-wiki/Punctured_Resumes.jpg" alt="an image with no alt text" /></p>
<p>In the early 1990s, I was a technology research analyst serving clients in the Advanced Technology Groups of major multinationals. My topic of focus then was neural networks. In those days, the area of handwriting recognition looked like it might yield to neural networks really well.</p>
<p>Reality proved to be more complicated. Accurate handwriting recognition turned out to be an amalgam of problems, such as ignoring the palm touching the screen; parsing words, then characters; disambiguating between conflicting meanings, and much more. Neural nets were a breakthrough for some of those elements, but needed to be integrated with other methods before reliable handwriting reco made it to market.</p>
<p>More recently, I was thinking radiology was a great example of a field that Generative AI might sweep through. That is, until I read <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/why-ai-isnt-replacing-radiologists">this article</a>, which did a great job of describing the complexities that make it unlikely that radiology will be taken over by GenAI in the near future.</p>
<p>Scaling back my ambitions for technology's advance, I've been using <em>tasks</em> as a unit of measure for that progress, not jobs. And it seems hard to argue that tasks aren't being knocked off by GenAI, one after the other.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean jobs aren't in trouble.</p>
<h2>Stepping through the process</h2>
<p>The first such task you successfully automate is likely a small victory. You've mastered this new technology enough to knock out a piece of drudge work. Huzzah!</p>
<p>If you choose tasks wisely, their automation is likely to affect more than one employee. Say the task is writing a report that requires combining information from multiple systems and offices. How many people spend how much time on that task across your company? Your challenge then is to spread the word â€” and the code.</p>
<p>On to the next candidate task. And the next. Mind you, this isn't happening serially, but rather in parallel, by many enterprising employees across the enterprise.</p>
<p>When GenAI achieves parity with an average worker on a given task, the things keeping it from being automated now are practicalities like: Do we have the time to do the automation? Can we validate the outputs?</p>
<p>Each task that you automate punches a hole in people's job descriptions. If you'll forgive the mixed metaphors, it's a bit of a Jenga tower: how many blocks can you remove before the tower tumbles?</p>
<p>In the workplace setting, how many tasks can we remove from your job description before we need to redesign your job dramatically?</p>
<h2>Are we that flexible?</h2>
<p>We're already seeing the bow wave of this change in large-scale job shifts, such as Salesforce saying tktktk and tktktk.</p>
<p>Augment vs replace.</p>
<p>We've been making sure people stay in their lanes and hit their KPIs or</p>
<h2>But, but...</h2>
<p>Experienced readers will have noted that this process should move quickly in high-trust organizations, but may bog down in low-trust ones.</p>
<p>Why should people aid in accelerating their unemployment? Anyone who has been watching US businesses the last few decades has <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/US_Businesses_Have_Given_Workers_Good_Reasons_to_Mistrust_Them.html">good reasons to worry</a>. This is a huge issue I'll return to in a later post.</p>
