      <p>The OODA Loop's four steps — Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act — were born in a madcap US Air Force Colonel's analysis of dogfights (airplane combat) in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. John Boyd was one of the US Armed Forces' smartest and most eccentric figures.</p>
<p>In the context of fighter aircraft pilots trying to kill each other, the process runs like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>Observe</strong> that you're over Laos in a Phantom F-4 fighter, chasing a MiG-19. We're both climbing while banking to the right. I'm at 15K feet and he's 2K feet above me.</li>
<li><strong>Orient</strong> pulls in everything you know about the situation and sets up your choices, but quickly. He is likely a North Vietnamese trained in China. You're in your first dogfight. His plane can out-turn and out-gun yours. You've been separated from your flight and are unlikely to survive the encounter unless you exit quickly.</li>
<li>You then <strong>Decide</strong> among my choices of action, and</li>
<li><strong>Act</strong> on your decision by pulling the throttle back, shifting the joystick and pedals, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whoever goes through the OODA Loop more quickly wins the dogfight. One pilot "gets inside" the other's OODA Loop, making better decisions and acting on them more quickly.</p>
<p>That's all well and good for aerial gladiatorial combat, but the OODA concept is surprisingly useful in other competitive situations, particularly in politics.</p>
<p>In the acknowledgements section of John Coram's biography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316881465/jerrymichalskisr">Boyd</a>, special thanks go to one character whose name you're sure to recognize: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney">Dick Cheney</a>. Well before he was the US Vice President, he was the Secretary of Defense for George HW Bush, and a major Boyd fan. In fact, Cheney called Boyd out of retirement to help develop the US Military's strategy in the First Gulf War.</p>
<p>Through Cheney and others, the OODA concept became common knowledge for Republican strategists; not so much the other side. A few years later, if you think back to the Kerry-Bush Jr. presidential campaign of 2004, you'll recall Kerry being "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiftboating">swiftboated</a>," being accused of flip-flopping, and more. That was OODA at work, and it helped a draft dodger hiding "youthful indiscretions" around drug use beat a decorated war hero who, on his return to the US, performed the second heroic task of testifying before Congress that the Vietnam War was borked tktktk.</p>
<p>Kerry and his Democratic advisors were completely unprepared for the OODA torrent heading their way. They weren't helped by</p>
