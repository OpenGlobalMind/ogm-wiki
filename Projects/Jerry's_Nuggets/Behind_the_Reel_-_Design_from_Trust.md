# Behind the Reel: Design from Trust

[My speaker's reel](https://vimeo.com/1006299404?share=copy) contains many fleeting moments that are really significant to me, so I'm elaborating on them in a quick series of posts. 

At [2:52 in the reel](https://vimeo.com/1006299404?share=copy#t=172.638) I mention two projects in passing, neither of which made the cut for deeper explanation in the reel: [[Behind the Reel - The Joy Line|The Joy Line]], and Design from Trust, which I describe here. 

Includes [[Design from Trust]]. 

Part of [[Behind the Reel (series)]].
