# This Kamala Moment

It's been less than two weeks since Joe Biden took the courageous step to withdraw from the 2024 Presidential election, endorsing his Vice President in the process. 

It's safe to say the intervening week has surprised many. On the Left, it's been a bit like that revival scene in Pulp Fiction:

On the Right, it's been a bit of a fall from the high of Trump's surviving an assassination attempt in a cinematic manner worthy of Tarantino or Scorsese, combined with the Trump-family-scripted Republican convention, coupled with the anointing of the presumptive heir to the MAGA throne, an erstwhile hillbilly turned reactionary. MAGAs everywhere were pretty sure a second Trump administration was nigh, which would let them get rid of those pesky elections, reporters and Democrats. 

Weird how much change a week or two can bring. 

Now there are 93 days until Election Day. 

It's worth pointing out that it took a mere 44 days from when UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak inexplicably called a snap election to his *having to move out of 10 Downing Street!* One evening he concedes the election; the next day his opponent is moving in. For being our stodgy elders, the Brits sure moved quickly! Hats off to you! (And I’ll save for a future post the desirability of quick, publicly funded elections.)
## Whither now? 

Back in the US, it seems there are two paths ahead to Election Day. The first has the Democrats' enthusiasm waning, their usual internecine battles rising, and the election becoming a nail-biting squeaker. 

The other path has the Democrats building from this fever pitch and sourcing a miracle blowout. (At this moment, I don't see a blowout the other direction.) But to achieve this, Democrats will have to break some norms and expectations. 

Want to win lasting loyalty? 

1. Admit that some Democratic initiatives over time have been flawed, and could use a collective re-think. 
2. Start some public processes for those re-thinks, featuring substantial (and occasionally contentious) debates out in the open. 
3. Open some side channels to talk to folks who have felt left out and left behind for decades. Go meta with them, sharing strategies and context, not just policies and victories. Be really frank. 
4. Open on-ramps for young white men who’ve gone MAGA. They’re in search of meaning, community, relationships, and context, all of which are findable in places other than 4chan and the [Manosphere](https://bra.in/3jX9ey). 

Democratic Business as Usual will lead to a squeaker election. Aren’t we tired of those, especially the ones lost by a few hanging chads? The shock of this moment (the needle of adrenaline to the heart?) creates a moment for deeper change. Let’s take advantage of it.
