The OODA Loop's four steps — Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act — were born in a madcap US Air Force Colonel's analysis of dogfights (airplane combat) in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. John Boyd was one of the US Armed Forces' smartest and most eccentric figures. 

In the context of fighter aircraft pilots trying to kill each other, the process runs like this: 

- You **Observe** that you're over Laos in a Phantom F-4 fighter, chasing a MiG-19. We're both climbing while banking to the right. I'm at 15K feet and he's 2K feet above me. 
- **Orient** pulls in everything you know about the situation and sets up your choices, but quickly. He is likely a North Vietnamese trained in China. You're in your first dogfight. His plane can out-turn and out-gun yours. You've been separated from your flight and are unlikely to survive the encounter unless you exit quickly. 
- You then **Decide** among my choices of action, and 
- **Act** on your decision by pulling the throttle back, shifting the joystick and pedals, etc. 

Whoever goes through the OODA Loop more quickly wins the dogfight. One pilot "gets inside" the other's OODA Loop, making better decisions and acting on them more quickly. 

That's all well and good for aerial gladiatorial combat, but the OODA concept is surprisingly useful in other competitive situations, particularly in politics. 

In the acknowledgements section of John Coram's biography [Boyd](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316881465/jerrymichalskisr), special thanks go to one character whose name you're sure to recognize: [Dick Cheney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney). Well before he was the US Vice President, he was the Secretary of Defense for George HW Bush, and a major Boyd fan. In fact, Cheney called Boyd out of retirement to help develop the US Military's strategy in the First Gulf War. 

Through Cheney and others, the OODA concept became common knowledge for Republican strategists; not so much the other side. A few years later, if you think back to the Kerry-Bush Jr. presidential campaign of 2004, you'll recall Kerry being "[swiftboated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiftboating)," being accused of flip-flopping, and more. That was OODA at work, and it helped a draft dodger hiding "youthful indiscretions" around drug use beat a decorated war hero who, on his return to the US, performed the second heroic task of testifying before Congress that the Vietnam War was borked tktktk. 

Kerry and his Democratic advisors were completely unprepared for the OODA torrent heading their way. They weren't helped by
