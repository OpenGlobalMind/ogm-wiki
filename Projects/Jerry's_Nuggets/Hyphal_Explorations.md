# Hyphal Explorations

Hyphae are the growing tips of mycelial (fungal) networks. 

Metaphorically, we're trying to create [The Big Fungus](https://www.thebigfungus.org/) as a shared memory in cyberspace. Let's think of [[Rel8 Pioneers|pioneers]] in this space as hyphae, at the leading edge of exploring how this all works. 

So this project is a container for these explorations.
