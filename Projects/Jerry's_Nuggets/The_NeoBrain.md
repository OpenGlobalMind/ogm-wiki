# The NeoBrain 
(draft) 
*Imagining an open, highly collaborative version of TheBrain* 

[TheBrain](http://www.thebrain.com) is a unique mind-mapping app that's been around since 1998. I was the first stop on their launch press tour back then, and turned into one of their lead users. You can learn more about my use of their software at [[Jerry's Brain]]. 

This is one of several [[ATproto Apps]] we would love to see exist.
