## Today's flavor smells like ass 

You'll notice that I have subsets in this collection, namely [Dysfunctional Variants of Capitalism](https://bra.in/9qVZVE) and its [Aspirational](https://bra.in/9qaoAm) opposites. Think of these as the Naughty and Nice versions. 

In the Dysfunctional list, you'll find Consumer Mass-Market Capitalism, which is the flavor I think we're living under right now.
