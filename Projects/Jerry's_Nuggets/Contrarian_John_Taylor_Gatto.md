# Contrarian: John Taylor Gatto
 
*Kids are naturally curious. Why do we stamp it out?*  

You'll find context for this post, which is part of a short series, [[Introducing My Contrarians|here]].

[Gatto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taylor_Gatto) is one of the crustiest contrarians I've had the pleasure to meet. We met for coffee on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in the 1990s. He recommended I read Carroll Quigley's [Tragedy and Hope](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/094500110X/jerrymichalskisr), which turned out to be the first good history book I ever read. Later, he was a guest on a panel that I hosted — which he effectively took over. 

Gatto opened my eyes to the genius in kids and the flawed design of our compulsory education system.

I'm pretty sure Gatto wasn't recommending we put all children into the military, or that we throw them into forced labor, but rather that young people are extraordinarily capable, a fact we not only seem to have forgotten, but are actively working against. 

We've been quietly extending childhood, removing responsibility from young people with [adolescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence) (a novel concept around 1904) and more recently [early adulthood](https://bra.in/9pR6Xx). C'mon now. 
## On schooling

The way Gatto won teaching prizes was by breaking many of the school's rules, though he wasn't saying that out loud. He would send his students to empty classrooms to work, unchaperoned. He had them in the streets of New York, selling local merchants ad space  in the newspaper they were creating. He trusted them and held them to very high standards. They loved it. 

When higher-ups started to send observers into his classrooms, he lost the the wiggle room to break those rules that obscurity gave him. Frustrated, he quit teaching and wrote [this op-ed](https://saintkosmas.org/gatto-i-quit-i-think) for the Wall Street Journal to describe why, then spent the rest of his life trying to convince everyone to trust children to be curious. It saddens me that that was his heresy. 

From that op-ed, this description of his complicity in a broken system: 
> I just can’t do it anymore. I can’t train children to wait to be told what to do; I can’t train people to drop what they are doing when a bell sounds; I can’t persuade children to feel some justice in their class placement when there isn’t any, and I can’t persuade children to believe teachers have valuable secrets they can acquire by becoming our disciples. That isn’t true.

Gatto liked to note that it only takes about 50 contact hours for a child to learn basic reading or math. The only important variable is that they have to want to, and that doesn't happen in the same month of the same year of their lives, which is how schooling was often delivered. 

A keen student of history, Gatto knew how the sausage that is the compulsory education system in America had been created. If you read Gatto's [Underground History of American Education](https://www.amazon.com/Underground-History-American-Education/dp/B000KF42JK/jerrymichalskisr) (wow! don't buy that one; read [this one](https://ia801803.us.archive.org/4/items/JohnTaylorGattoTheUndergroundHistoryOfAmericanEducationBook/John%20Taylor%20Gatto%20-%20The%20Underground%20History%20of%20American%20Education%20Book.pdf)), you'll learn about [[The Hidden Curriculum of School]]. 

Here's how I described Gatto's work at U22:

As you'll see in this short series, Contrarians are masters of [[Rethink Constraints|rethinking constraints]]. They are also the foundations of [[Design from Trust]].
