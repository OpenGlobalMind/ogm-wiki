Howdy! This is the first post in my new podcast called Rethink the Future, which lives inside my Rethink Your Constraints Substack.

It appears that governments around the world, including the USA, are sliding toward autocracy and other things that shouldn't appeal to the general public, but in fact, do. I think the reason they do is that the current systems are borked and nobody has proposed a 

### Scope 
Lots to say about how we got here. Some will filter in. 

But I want to look forward, focus on ways to build a better world together.

Topics will include: 

- Promising Solutions to World Crises and Thorny Social Problems 
- What Does It Mean to Be a Good Cyborg? 
- Design from Trust 
- Collaborative Sensemaking 
- Here’s a link to [the Scope collection](https://bra.in/5vPLEJ) in my Brain

### Formats 
Mixed! Might be just me talking in a chair or on the hoof, me interviewing one or two people, small-group discussions, open sessions, screencasts, Braincasts, animations. Very linky. 

From one minute to a couple hours. No set schedule. Content over production value. 

### Notes 

This is a Substack, so your likes and subscribes are super helpful. Of course, so is your becoming a paid subscriber. Doing so will bring you into a private monthly call, where we scheme world domination, as well as invitations to participate in occasional Substack chats as well as Zoom calls that will show up on the podcast. 

My overarching goal here is to capture some of the fun and magic of collaborating with others to make things better, while leaving a trail of resources that anyone can use and improve. I’m open to all suggestions: content, formats, questions to pursue. Anything. Lmk what's working for you.
