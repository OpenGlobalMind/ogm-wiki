# An Antifragile Sense of Nation 
 (draft) 
*We've been doing it wrong.*  

"It" is nationkeeping. 

​Denying a country's darker moments and impulses is the birthplace of nationalism, jingoism and xenophobia, isn't it? Do we have to glorify the country all the time, erasing its errors, as Trump is assiduously doing now? I find that not just a lie, but dangerous. 

The more interesting question may be how to deal with errors while growing pride. In an Antifragile way. I like that.
