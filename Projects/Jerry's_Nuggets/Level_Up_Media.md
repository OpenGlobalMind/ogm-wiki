# Level Up Media

In 2022, I posted [[The Internet Is Stuck in Mainstream Media Metaphors]]. 

- Early movies filmed theater  
- Then filmmakers innovated, inventing the language of cinema (pan, zoom, jump cut, montage)  
- The Web now emulates magazine articles, radio shows, TV and movies. Old media.  

We're at a moment where we can level up, transforming media.

Leveling up media will help us [[Save Civilization]] together.

The Copyright Industries will likely fight this. [[The Creatorâ€™s Dilemma]]. 

To level up media, let's:

- Create [[The NeoBooks Manifesto|NeoBooks]] 
- Present Using [[NeoDecks]] 
- Curate [[The Big Fungus]] together 
- [[Turbocharge Pattern Languages]]
