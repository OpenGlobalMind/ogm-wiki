# Collections to Feed the Big Fungus

[[The Big Fungus]] is a metaphoric way of describing the shared memory that Rel8 seeks to catalyze. 

To be a useful shared memory, the Big Fungus will live at the intersection of many collections of notes, maps, tags and links. 

To start, we'll [[Inoculate The Big Fungus]]. Then we'll feed it [[Pattern Languages of Interest]], as part of the [[Turbocharge Pattern Languages]] project.
