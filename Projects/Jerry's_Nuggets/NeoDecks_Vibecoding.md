# NeoDecks Vibecoding 

The idea of [[NeoDecks]] is to have a fully functional presentation app, where the slides are separate slides and can be composed into multiple presentations. 

Here are the features I would love to have in a NeoDecks app:
- In this presentation app, each slide is a separate markdown page. 
- One page contains the playlist of all the pages in a particular presentation. Different presentations can point to the same slide.
- Play feature that goes full screen, and enables the left and right row keys to march through a playlist of pages that are on the master NeoDeck, its table of contents.
- Slide-sorter view that lets you see renderings of all the pages and reorder them.
- Future plans for themes, transitions, builds, and other simple effects.
- Provision should be made for seamless shifting between editing and playing modes. Preferably a modeless interface.
- The target Markdown editor is Obsidian. 
- All code generated here is to be open source, written in a way that it is easily contributed to whatever open source depositories make sense.
