In pro wrestling, [Kayfabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe) is the shared fiction that what's happening in the ring is real. (If this is your first notice that this action tktk is real, my apologies.)

As pro wrestling has grown and matured — a word I will use with tongue planted firmly in cheek — it has also gone meta, spilling out of the ring into our everyday world, spawning a durable, popular soap opera with villains and heroes, plot twists, betrayals and more. It's all kayfabe. 

Who's been hip-deep in pro wrestling for years?

The 45th and 47th President of the United States, that's who. 

Now you might think pro wrestling was just a way for Trump to get attention and make a buck with his casinos and hotels, which isn't wrong, but you'd miss much more to this plot. 

## Enter Gorgeous George 

Pro wrestlers have a crazy variety of names and personas, including in [Lucha Libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucha_libre) across Latin America or the [wrestling Cholitas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxum-hdUdRI) of Bolivia. The most popular wrestlers fall into one of two types: they are either [Faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)) ("babyface" heroes) or [Heels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)) (villains). 

[Gorgeous George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgeous_George) was one of the most famous Heels from the US scene in the 1950s. Dressed in gold tights and cape with curly blond locks, he would preen and fuss tktk in the ring, working everyone up. Crowds loved him. 

This may seem timeworn now, but he was a pioneer. And guess who admired his act and borrowed it? None other than a gifted boxer named Muhammad Ali. 

Remember Ali's mugging, preening and dancing? His amazing interviews? "I'm too handsome to get hit"? His poetry, the precursor to rap? tktktk 

Now guess who admired both Ali and Gorgeous George, and borrowed from both. 

## Mix in Reality TV

Kayfabe or... Reality TV. The Apprentice. 

Now rethink both Trump Administrations as Kayfabe and Reality TV.
