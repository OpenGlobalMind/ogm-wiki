# Whatâ€™s a NeoBook?
(draft) 
*Rethinking how ideas have sex.* 

If you deduced "new" and "book," you're on the right path, but you're only getting the tip of the story. You see, the "book" part is only there as bait. A NeoBook can look like a book, which is a recognizable cultural artifact. Smart people put their knowledge inside books, right? 

But the book aspect of a NeoBook is just a starting point, a familiar frame of reference. From there, things get really interesting, because:

- The NeoBook is composed of "Nuggets" that live independently online. 
- More specifically, [[NeoBooks Are Playlists of Specific Nuggets]].
	- Any of which might be part of a different NeoBook.
	- All of which connect visitors to additional resources, plus (importantly) conversations and communities related to each nugget. 

So a good NeoBook is alive, in the sense that it lives in community, which tries to improve the work over time. 

One reason for NeoBooks is a belief that [[Books and PDFs Are Where Ideas Go to Die]]. We need to [[Help Ideas Have Sex]], for which we need to [[Level Up Media]].
