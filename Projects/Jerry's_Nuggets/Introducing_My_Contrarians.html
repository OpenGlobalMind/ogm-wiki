      <h1>Introducing: My Contrarians</h1>
<p><em>Sensible folks who have defied conventional wisdom.</em></p>
<p><img src="/ogm-wiki/j3rry_spiff_abstract_image_depicting_how_Contrarians_are_ofte_747e833d-e4e7-4377-ba85-df8a3f82ee56_3.png" alt="an image with no alt text" /></p>
<p>We do live in interesting times. The <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/12/18/live/">curse</a> is complete.</p>
<p>These times also seem dangerous, head-spinning, disorienting, distressing, and, every now and then, promising. How we respond matters a great deal.</p>
<p>My preferred mode of response — alas, not always the one that comes out my mouth or fingertips — is to describe positive futures and work toward making them real. The positive futures I imagine involve major redesigns of the systems, institutions and norms we often take for granted today.</p>
<p>I was on this quest before the 2016 US election, as you'll see from the stories I tell in this series. The chain of events since 2016 seems to have softened up our old institutions (perhaps an understatement), while hardening up the humans and creating a huge amount of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Still, uncertainty and change spell opportunity. The confluence of Generative AI, geopolitical flux, harsher climate events and whatever your other favorite ingredient of the polycrisis is has created a moment for reinvention.</p>
<p>My best ideas about reinvention were sparked by a series of sages I discovered, each of whom was offering a sensible critique of their field, from education to urban design and creating abundance. I took to calling them my Contrarians.</p>
<h2>About those Contrarians</h2>
<p>In 2022, I had the pleasure of giving a unique keynote in Bucharest as part of [Unfinished 2022](Unfinished 2022). You can watch the whole talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N47GRiYZ0p8">here</a>, but I've realized that the ideas it contains deserve individual presentation, so I'm posting this short series examining them in turn.</p>
<p>The theme of my U22 keynote was explaining the thinking behind my Unfinished keynote two years prior, which I titled <a href="https://youtu.be/gf3vp0Wquz8">Trust Is the (Only) Way Forward</a>. How did I decide that trust is the way forward, even in our low-trust times?</p>
<p>A big chunk of that thesis came from my slow discovery over time of a series of Contrarians, an eclectic collection of relative unknowns (as you'll see in subsequent clips) who transformed their sectors by defying conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>It took me some time to get there, but gradually I realized their critiques had a huge theme in common. The paragraph none of them uttered that I know of, but which I'm pretty sure they all would have agreed with is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my field, years ago, we lost faith in humans and redesigned our systems and institutions on a basis of mistrust of the average person. That has left us with congenitally flawed institutions that often do a lot of damage. It turns out that if you flip that assumption and start with a belief that most (though not all) people are trustworthy, you get much better results — and very different solutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this short section of the U22 talk, I frame the notion of Contrarians:</p>

<p>To pick up the story, please head to my description of the Contrarian named <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Contrarian_Harrison_Owen.html">Harrison Owen</a>, the first of five whose stories and heresies I tell in this series. Here are the other four:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Contrarian_Hans_Monderman.html">Hans Monderman</a></li>
<li><a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Contrarian_Elinor_Ostrom.html">Elinor Ostrom</a></li>
<li><a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Contrarian_John_Taylor_Gatto.html">John Taylor Gatto</a></li>
<li><a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Contrarian_Christopher_Alexander.html">Christopher Alexander</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you'll see in this short series, Contrarians are masters of <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Rethink_Constraints.html">rethinking constraints</a>. They are also the foundations of <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Design_from_Trust.html">Design from Trust</a>.</p>
<p>A confession or warning: only one of the five Contrarians I profiled in this talk is a woman; the rest are oldish white men. In part this is because I chose the stories I knew best from among my larger collection of Contrarians, and also I was biased toward the few that I've met in person.</p>
<p>If you read this far, a treat: In <a href="https://www.jerrysbrain.com/">my online Brain</a>, you'll find all my Contrarians <a href="https://bra.in/4jrdQp">here</a>, where you can see them in their greater context.</p>
