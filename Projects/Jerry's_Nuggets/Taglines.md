# Taglines
(draft) 
*What if you had a collection of every tagline you've run into?* 

I do. 

At some point in the dim and distant past, when URLs were exciting and I started adding companies to my Brain, I started systematically adding any taglines I found to my Brain, as well, right under their companies or products. 

You can browse that collection tktkhere.
