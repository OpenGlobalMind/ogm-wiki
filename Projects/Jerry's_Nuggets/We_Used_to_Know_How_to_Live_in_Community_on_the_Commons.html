      <h1>We Used to Know How to Live in Community, on the Commons</h1>
<p>My, how we've grown! &lt;/irony&gt;</p>
<p><img src="/ogm-wiki/j3rry_spiff_conceptual_art_illustrating_the_statement_We_Used_8fddefa3-ef0a-4dda-808f-47c8957aca5a_1.png" alt="an image with no alt text" /></p>
<p>Too many people are convinced that life used to be nasty, brutish, and short. Our lifespans were short, the narrative goes. Violence was everywhere, with humans barely staying alive on a hostile landscape. Then "civilization" saved us, starting with agriculture, which forced us to stay put.</p>
<p>I no longer believe that story. Over the years, many different thinkers have convinced me that in many places — not everywhere — humans knew how to take care of the landscape and they knew how to take care of one another. We knew how to live in community, on <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/The_Commons.html">the Commons</a> (which I always capitalize, out of respect, like "Internet," oddly enough).</p>
<p>This sentence was the starting assumption of <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/My_Story_of_Trust.html">My Story of Trust</a>.</p>
<h2>Hard-won wisdom</h2>
<p>Knowing how to live in community, on the Commons, wasn't innate for humans: it was hard-won wisdom. We did manage to kill ourselves off, time after time. We wiped out megafauna, overgrazed, chopped down handy forests, overfished, and in other ways made it hard to stay alive. We saw famines and epidemics. We also attacked one another pretty consistently, with lethality increasing as weapons improved and forms of social organization allowed for larger armies.</p>
<p>Living in harmony with the land and one another takes patience, effort and wisdom, particularly the kinds of wisdom that have been passed down through the centuries. For example, the core principles of many indigenous traditions around the world revolve around stewardship and community. These include:</p>

<p>Much of this wisdom predates writing. It was passed down through generations in rituals, oral traditions, cultural practices, apprenticeships and other means. Some of it is deeply tied to language and country, in ways that make it hard — if not impossible — to capture and pass on through traditional Western forms of communication, such as this post.</p>
<p>Some of the more accessible insights that have stuck with me include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cultures I'm citing were more concerned with stewardship than ownership.</li>
<li>Many managed their landscapes collectively over time, as opposed to private plots for commerce and private consumption.</li>
<li>They did their best to bring bad actors back into their communities. Ostracism and death were actions of last resort. They favored counsel over cancel.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are fodder for future posts.</p>
<h2>Coming full circle</h2>
<p>Alas, Colonialism did its level best to ignore, suppress, or destroy all that hard-won wisdom.</p>
<p>Now we're struggling with these very issues: We've lost our sense of community and we've despoiled our many Commons. Then we bemoan the situation and wrack our brains about how it could have happened.</p>
<p>As if these struggles weren't complicated enough, they are compounded by the swift, recent rise of Generative AI, which could help or harm, and is almost certainly an accelerator of change: Will we all go cuddle with our new GenAI BFFs, forgetting about community entirely? Or will GenAI therapists help us reconnect with other humans? Will GenAI help us make more rational use of our resources and spaces? Or will GenAI plunder our remaining Commons at warp speed?</p>
<p>How might we win back what we once knew? Not turn back the clock, but rather blend the best of the old with the best of the new. That's the hopeful quest that I invite you on.</p>
<p>Recent books offer us great clues, including:</p>
