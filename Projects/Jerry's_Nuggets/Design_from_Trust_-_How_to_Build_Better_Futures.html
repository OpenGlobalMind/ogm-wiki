</ul>
<p>They all share a particular dependence on trust, an insight it took me over a decade to see and articulate.</p>
<p>Somewhere around 2012, it dawned on me that most of my longtime role models and inspirations — the people who innovated the various systems I just listed (and <a href="https://bra.in/4pxQ56">many more</a>) — had several profound things in common.</p>
<p>First, I realized that most of my role models were contrarians. They swam against the main stream. Each of the contrarians was carrying a message difficult enough for their peers to hear that they were often marginalized or ridiculed by those peers. Their insights ran against their discipline's standing conventional wisdom: Let <em>any</em> worker stop the assembly line? We'll never get anything built! Give people with <em>no</em> collateral loans? No way! Let <em>any</em> fool on the planet edit the Wikipedia? Are you nuts? <em>Remove</em> traffic lights? Seriously?</p>
<p>You see what I mean.</p>
<p>Then, slowly, I discovered the thread that connected their initiatives, an approach I called Design from Trust (and abbreviate as DfT). This post is a foundational exposition of DfT.</p>
<p><strong>Design from Trust creates systems based on the assumption that participants are responsible and well-intentioned, rather than designing for the worst-case scenario.</strong> Those participants not only want to enjoy the system's benefits, some even wish to help improve it. Instead of designing systems as if everyone is potentially a bad actor, limiting everyone's behavior and discouraging them from engaging positively, DfT flips the script, and deals with the bad actors later, sometimes cleverly turning them into good actors.</p>
<h2>Trust compounds and rebounds</h2>
<p>Trust has countless facets, from improving interpersonal trust to building high-trust teams, using transparency to increase trust, designing the <em>appearance</em> of trust (why bank buildings used to have Greek columns out front and a big, visible safe inside), and revealing and fixing defects in a system to raise long-term trust (versus denying that there's anything wrong).</p>
<p>The facet that Design from Trust focuses on is systems design as it relates to trust.</p>
<p>What's crazy about DfT is that redesigning systems in this way has positive effects on many of the other facets: trust compounds and rebounds. For example, empowering everyone to stop the assembly line builds high-trust teams and improves product quality. Hosting Unconferences (instead of programming every moment of an event with famous speakers, fancy panels, and highly facilitated exercises) is a gesture of trust to your participants, and engages them by sharing the responsibility for the event with them. How's that for audience "engagement"? Adopting Open Source software or Workplace Democracy directly increases transparency — and trust. Addressing problems in a system's <em>design</em> can resolve "downstream" problems that resist other approaches.</p>
<p>Most systems telegraph their distrust through their design, through the glaring or subtle elements that tell us to stay in our lane, not question the system, or obey a signal instead of connecting with others. That starts a downward spiral, since many people treated as untrustworthy won't have many reasons to behave better. We respond to the way we are treated. Approach me looking for the best in me and I'll try to live up to your expectations; approach me as if I'm a thief or criminal and I'm likely to disconnect, or worse.</p>
<p>For example, researchers at Boston University Medical Center discovered that <a href="https://www.bu.edu/fammed/projectred/">redesigning</a> the hospital's discharge process to assume patient wanted to get healthy but got tangled in the many details (as opposed to assuming they were not going to comply) reduced readmissions by 30 percent.</p>
<h2>Risk is useful</h2>
<p>Modern design seems allergic to risk, perhaps a response to a very litigious society. tktktk</p>
<p>Instead of designing out all risks, Design from Trust lets some risks engage participants and inspire them to contribute significantly to the systems' healthy functioning. For example, if pedestrians, bicyclists and drivers don't slow down, make eye contact, and pace-match through intersections, <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Contrarian_Hans_Monderman.html">Traffic Calming</a> fails and people get hurt. Yet they do those things. People step up, and traffic flows naturally. Similarly, if nobody steps forward at an <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Contrarian_Harrison_Owen.html">Unconference</a> and names a topic for conversation, there won't be any sessions. Yet they do step forward.</p>
<p>Leaving some risk in the system puts some responsibility for the system's success in participants' hands.</p>
<p>This sharing of risk and responsibility not only works, it transforms participants subtly. The shift from being an audience member to co-creating the event's content and value is a gift of agency, a thing our consumerist, command-and-control world has stolen from us. Letting anyone edit the world's encyclopedia is a way of metaphorically leaving the key in the door, inviting people to help. It is a gesture of trust.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The shift from being an audience member to co-creating the event's content and value is a gift of agency, a thing our consumerist, command-and-control world has stolen from us.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think our souls react favorably to these gestures of trust. Our souls are then hungry for a bit more of this elixir, but they don't know where to turn. Design from Trust is the thread that connects these systems so we can find other systems that share these traits, and even better: so we can redesign dysfunctional systems using consistent principles.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, my catalyst for these insights was the single word "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VfeuITmNUk">consumer</a>."</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/projects/jerry%27s_nuggets/my_story_of_trust">Somehow</a>, over the past multiple decades (and centuries), we lost faith in humans. Then we designed most of our institutions as if everyone was a bad actor. (The "we" I mean is complex, and involves many different actors at many different times, collectively designing, tweaking and implementing the major systems we use every day, from education to transportation, elections, publishing, entertainment, and more.)</p>
<p>What's worse, we adapted. We got used to it. We take mistrust completely for granted now. We've normalized it so thoroughly that mistrust is our default setting and <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/The_2_Oh_Shit!s.html">we're startled</a> when that setting switches. (Years later, I realized that we "<a href="https://bra.in/2joMDY">consumerized</a>" almost every aspect of our lives.)</p>
<p>This wasn't always so. Long ago, we figured out <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/We_Used_to_Know_How_to_Live_in_Community_on_the_Commons.html">how to live in community, on the Commons</a>. It was hard-won wisdom, and we've forgotten most of it.</p>
<p>Actually, we didn't just forget it. We steamrolled it over a couple centuries with the mutually reinforcing dynamics of several isms: colonialism, industrialism, capitalism, consumerism, and modernism. Now we're rugged individuals in the ownership society — treated as <a href="https://bra.in/8vBzBa">consumers, not citizens</a> — and we wonder why so many of us feel apathetic, disconnected, sad, and powerless.</p>
<p>Discovering the thread that connects my contrarians brought me to believe not only that we have an opportunity to redesign everything from trust, but that <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Trust_Is_the_(Only)_Way_Forward.html">trust is the (only) way forward</a>.</p>
<h2>Reality check</h2>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa!, I hear your brain say: has Jerry read the news? It seems trust is in tatters these days. Aren't there a lot of bad actors out there? Don't people around the world seem hungrier for change than for trust? Don't trusting societies always lose to violent ones? Isn't Generative AI making this all more difficult? And how do you scale trust? Isn't Design from Trust the most naïve program anyone's ever put forth?</p>
<p>I can't blame you for being skeptical. It's certainly time for a reality check in this post, and it's easy to see how DfT might seem an idealist's dream. Allow me to build a case for it.</p>
<p>First, <strong>Design from Trust is not naïve trust.</strong> The world definitely has bad actors, some of whom are really smart and well organized. But we shouldn't let them dictate how we design our world, which is somehow where we've ended up.</p>
<p>When you do meet the bad actors, two points: 1) It's important to know how to defend yourself, which then lets you choose to be undefended (a gesture of trust), not defenseless; and 2) What <em>some</em> of the bad actors want is to be heard, or to belong. Design from Trust gives them that, which may help turn them into good actors.</p>
<p>Second, you may also be thinking: <strong>Trust doesn't scale!</strong> What's true here is that using industrial methods to create trust doesn't scale. We are humans, not robots (yet). Partly, we've lost our perspective on large-scale social trust because we've been designing most everything for efficiency, scale and profit, deprecating meaning and connection. Trust does scale, but it does so organically and adaptively, by giving people design options they opt into and make their own, not by imposing "best practices" from outside.</p>
<p>Third, <strong><a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/The_Alternatives_to_Sorting_Out_Trust_All_Suck.html">the alternatives to sorting out trust all suck</a></strong>. From relying on technologists to fix our problems to donning goggles and living in the Metaverse or colonizing Mars because we've spoiled our planet, I don't see a plausible, popular vision out there that leads to a society worth loving.</p>
<p>Shifting to the positive, consider the benefits of leveraging authentic trust.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Trust:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Trust_Is_Cheaper_Than_Control.html">cheaper than control</a></li>
<li>Connects people, builds community</li>
<li>Unlocks genius</li>
<li>Begets <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlo8d7F5hdo">abundance</a></li>
<li>Differentiates organizations (especially in low-trust times)</li>
<li>Feels great, even when it's scary</li>
</ul>
<p>It's also fragile. And <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Trust_is….html">more</a>.</p>
<p>Covering all these angles in depth would turn this post into a paper or a book, so I'll be writing posts about them all, plus the many other issues I'm just brushing here. Follow or subscribe if you'd like to join the journey. <a href="mailto:sociate@gmail.com">Contact me</a> if you'd like to explore these issues for your organization.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>Designing from (<a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/From_Trust,_Not_For.html">not for</a>) trust usually isn't a patch to existing systems. It requires thoughtful (re)design that follows a set of principles.</p>
<p>Wikipedia illustrates this need for thoughtful redesign nicely. It wasn't originally a wiki at all. It <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Wikipedia_Started_as_the_Nupedia.html">started life as the Nupedia project</a>, modeled on traditional publishing. When that effort wasn't working, the project team had a caterpillar-to-butterfly moment that was neither obvious nor easy, but which led to the team's finding a way to the organic, explosive growth that gave us the modern Wikipedia.</p>
<p>In this case, the inventors of the Wiki did the thoughtful Design from Trust; Wikipedians adopted and inherited it, then enhanced it as they solved problems that smaller wiki sites hadn't yet hit, as well as .</p>
<p>In Design from Trust, just <strong>seeing</strong> the contradictions isn't enough. You have to <strong>shift</strong> your thinking, because from today's default frame of mind, many of the solutions DfT proposes seem counterintuitive or downright crazy, as I described earlier. A real shift allows you then to <strong>shape</strong> the new dynamics you want to create, then <strong>set</strong> it all in motion.</p>
<p>Underpinning this change model are the <a href="https://bra.in/5jkNwq">Principles of Design from Trust</a>, which start with <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Assume_Good_Faith.html">Assume Good Faith</a> (or Intent). More on these soon, too.</p>
<p>Finally, because Design from Trust is the common thread connecting very different movements and industries, your ability to see it improves the more stories you hear of DfT examples. I've started telling these stories <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Introducing_My_Contrarians.html">here</a> and <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Shorts_to_Revitalize_Cities.html">here</a> and would love to spark others' extending this catalog.</p>
<p>Storytelling is key to our collective growth.</p>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>Design from Trust addresses many topical questions. For example, it can help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build authentic, durable trust with our clients and customers (and employees and suppliers).</li>
<li>Break the grip of addictive social media and surveillance capitalism.</li>
<li>Rebuild trust in institutions (by changing them, not by marketing them better).</li>
<li>Retake control over the design of our living spaces and institutions.</li>
<li>Bridge the political divides that separate us.</li>
<li>Repair our failing systems, from education and governance to health care, urban design and more.</li>
<li>Help people connect to meaning and purpose.</li>
<li>Help young folk find their way into promising adulthood.</li>
<li>Make the best use of Generative AI to create positive futures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lovely, useful ideas spill out when you flip your assumptions about trust, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlo8d7F5hdo&amp;feature=youtu.be">Scarcity = Abundance - Trust</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkjEOigXUrk">The Joy Line</a>, and, well, Design from Trust itself 😁.</p>
<p>If we do this right, we might collectively construct a <a href="https://www.thebetterverse.org/">Betterverse</a>.</p>
<p>Design from Trust isn't a theory waiting to be tested. It's <a class="wikilink" href="/ogm-wiki/Projects/Jerry's_Nuggets/Design_from_Trust_Is_Widespread_Already.html">already working in the real world</a> — you've probably experienced it yourself. The breakthrough isn't inventing it. The breakthrough is recognizing that these seemingly unrelated successes share a common architecture. Once you see it, you can build it anywhere.</p>
