# SenseDoing 

## Project Overview 

OGM and partner communities want to engage in practical sensemaking. This wiki page is ground zero for that effort at this moment. 

Please conduct all conversation about this project on [our SenseDoing chat channel](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-sensedoing).
