# Turbocharge Pattern Languages

*To make existing pattern languages more accessible, useable and useful.* 

This is a [[Rel8 Projects|Rel8 Project]].

[[Pattern Languages]] are community projects that make distilled wisdom more accessible. We are big fans of several existing Pattern Languages, including: 
- [Peeragogy](https://peeragogy.org/)
- [Liberating Structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/)
- [The Wise Democracy Pattern Language](https://www.wd-pl.com/) 
- [An Open Source Pattern Language (re)generative of Commons](https://debategraph.org/Details.aspx?nid=329727)

Pattern Languages don't get enough love â€” or use. Let's enhance their visibility, availability, connectivity and usefulness as much as we can. 

To Turbocharge Pattern Languages, we might:

- Weave existing Pattern Languages together, as appropriate
- Make it easier to create and curate Pattern Languages
- Get the word out about Pattern Languages
- Start needed Pattern Languages, like maybe:
	- [[A Pattern Language for Healing the Earth]]
- Program chatbots to navigate Pattern Languages and make great recommendations from them 
- "Instrument" them, where appropriate, which means turning text into code that makes applying patterns far easier (see [[Tile - 1-2-4-All Zoom App]])
	- Lather, rinse, repeat for more wise nuggets that are instrumentable
