# On Men and Masculinity, with Moe Carrick 
 
*What's happening to masculinity?* 

I'm focusing the [Rethink the Future podcast](https://rethinkconstraints.substack.com/podcast) on ways of co-creating a better future. These days, it seems that my use of "co-creating" will remain wishful thinking unless we address what's been happening to boys and men. So let's start that conversation. 

[Moe Carrick](https://bra.in/8jkoVZ) has been helping organizations improve their teams and culture for some time, writing three books on the subject along the way. We met recently, at the [Responsive](https://www.responsiveconference.com/) conference in Oakland. 

A longtime TEDx licensee and motive power behind TEDxBend, Moe gave a talk at TEDxSalem that sparked this podcast conversation. It's titled [Loving Men: Rethinking Women’s Role in Defining Masculinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7KVrxjkmic). 

Moe and I let our conversation range freely, so we could bring different facets of the dynamics for boys and men into focus and see how they influence one another. Here's the episode:

## Takeaways

Masculinity is in a transition with no guidebook. Old norms are collapsing, but the new ones are still fuzzy.

Far right movements built cultural “catchers mitts” for lonely young men, and those mitts work frighteningly well.

Feminist progress lifted many women, but the parallel support structures for men never materialized.

Shame blocks growth. If men feel blamed for everything, they disappear into defensiveness.

Healthy masculinity probably includes stewardship, emotional awareness, capability, tenderness, and responsibility. Which is to say, full humanity.

Belonging is oxygen. People will take it wherever they can find it, even if the price is high.

Redefining masculinity is not a niche project. It shapes democracy, families, community, and the social contract itself.
