# Writing Wikily

Wikis are social writing environments. They help groups craft pages of content that include useful links connecting those pages, and also links to outside artifacts. 

Writing for a wiki requires a few shifts of thinking, including:

- Deciding how much text constitutes a page, a process I call "[[Nuggetization]]"
- Writing for re-use, so one page/Nugget can contribute to the broader web of ideas
- Setting norms for the wiki, from tone and Nugget size to protocols for links, etc. 
- Adding metadata in useful ways.
