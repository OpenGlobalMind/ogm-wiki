# The Social Contract Is Broken
(draft) 
*The confusion, grief and rage are real.* 

The many protest movements over the last few decades, from [Cacerolazos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacerolazo) and [Occupy Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street) to the [Arab Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring), [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter), and [MAGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again), have a common thread: they were all started by people unhappy with their circumstances inside the systems they are trapped in. People who believed their social contracts are broken. They verbalize this in myriad ways: The system is rigged! 

The belief that links these movements is that life under the present regime is intolerable, and that the next generation's lives look to be worse than the present. Our children's lives are going to suck. Nobody wants that. 

My conclusion from these movements is that [[We Are Involuntarily Renegotiating the Social Contract]] around the world. What's worse, nobody has a great solution.
