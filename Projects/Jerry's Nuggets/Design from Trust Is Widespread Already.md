Have you surfed the Internet? Used a ride-sharing service like Uber or Lyft? Attended an Unconference? Held any Local Currency? Made a Microloan through Kiva? Been to a store or restaurant where you could Pay What You Want? Used the Wikipedia? Served time in Norway? Honored an Honor Code? Attended Quaker Meeting? Cultivated an Edible Landscape? Paid something forward? Received an Unconditional Cash Transfer? Experienced Workplace Democracy? Used Open Source code? Engaged in Restorative Justice? Unschooled your kids? Walked or driven through a Traffic Calmed intersection? 

If your answer to any of those is yes, you've already experienced [Design from Trust](https://www.designfromtrust.com/). 

Design from Trust didn't start as an abstract model built up from first principles about trust and social dynamics. It showed up when I identified the common threads that wove through many of these examples of existing systems that are unusual, yet successful in the real world. 

The early examples often showed up in stories about their inventors. For example, the story of [Muhammad Yunus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UCuWxWiMaQ) giving a $27 loan to a circle of 42 Bangladeshi women who had zero collateral taught me about microfinance. [Pam Warhurst's TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KmKoj4RSZw) explained how inspired citizens could turn ordinary towns into edible landscapes, transforming their town, creating food, and building community. [[Contrarian John Taylor Gatto|John Taylor Gatto]] convinced me that our compulsory education system stamps out curiosity and our sense of agency, and ought to be replaced with something more like self-directed education.

I'll be describing those connective threads more shortly, in these posts. Subscribe or follow if you'd like to see how it goes. 

Design from Trust describes the thread, tracing a reliable process for transformative change that builds back community, trust and purpose. I'll be describing that here as well. 

If we adopted Design from Trust, we might solve big problems in today's world. When trust is at a deep ebb, organizations that offer real trust will stand out. There is a hunger in the world for trustworthy systems and organizations. Getting there isn't easy, but is far from impossible.
