# Design from Trust Is Widespread Already

*It's just that nobody calls it that.* 

Have you used the Internet? Used a ride-sharing service like Uber or Lyft? Attended an Unconference? Used any Local Currency? Made a Microloan through Kiva? Been to a store or restaurant where you could Pay What You Want? Edited the Wikipedia? Served time in Norway? Honored an Honor Code? Attended Quaker Meeting? Cultivated an Edible Landscape? Paid something forward? Received an Unconditional Cash Transfer? Experienced Workplace Democracy? Written Open Source code? Engaged in Restorative Justice? Tried Unschooling? Walked or driven through a Traffic Calmed intersection? 

If your answer to any of those is yes, you've already experienced Design from Trust. 

The idea for Design from Trust showed up when I noticed the common threads that wove through many of these examples. It wasn't an abstract idea built up from first principles about trust and social dynamics. 

Often I learned about these examples by hearing the stories of their inventors. For example, the story of Muhammad Yunus giving a small loan to a circle of 21 Bangladeshi women taught me about microfinance. [Pam Warhurst's TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KmKoj4RSZw) taught me about turning towns into edible landscapes. John Taylor Gatto convinced me that our compulsory education system stamps out curiosity and our sense of agency, and ought to be replaced with self-directed education.
