# Whatâ€™s a NeoBook?

First, a NeoBook looks like a book, which is a recognizable cultural artifact. Smart people put their knowledge inside books, right? 

But the book aspect of a NeoBook is just a starting point, a familiar frame of reference. From there, things get really interesting, because:

- The NeoBook is composed of "nuggets" that live independently online. 
- More specifically, the NeoBook is a playlist of specific nuggets.
	- Any of which might be part of a different NeoBook.
- Those nuggets connect visitors to additional resources, plus(importantly) conversations and communities related to each nugget.
