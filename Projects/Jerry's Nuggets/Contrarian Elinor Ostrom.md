*Commons don't have to be tragedies!* 

You'll find context for this post, which is part of a short series, [[Introducing My Contrarians|here]]. 

I'm constantly amazed at how well we've flushed the word "Commons" — which I always capitalize, out of respect — from our collective memories. Now and then in talks I will ask people to define a Commons, and there's usually an awkward silence. Then somebody says "forests!" and somebody else says "clean water!" Then we're off to the races.

Unfortunately, this 1968 paper seems to have eaten our brains. The default setting in our heads is now that Commons are practically impossible. So we don't think about them as solutions to some of our problems, when in fact, Commons are the way to go.

Next up: Contrarian John Taylor Gatto. 

As you'll see in this short series, Contrarians are masters of [[Rethink Constraints|rethinking constraints]]. They are also the foundations of [[Design from Trust]]. 

If you read this far, a treat: In [my online Brain](https://www.jerrysbrain.com/), you'll find all my Contrarians [here](https://bra.in/4jrdQp), where you can see them in their greater context.
