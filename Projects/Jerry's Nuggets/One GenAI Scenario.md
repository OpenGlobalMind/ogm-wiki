# One GenAI Scenario 
(draft) 
*How this thing might play out.* 

Here's one narrative of how the next decade or two might play out, given the current state of GenAI and the promises (and threats) that it holds. 

Generative AI progress continues (we're not at a plateau).
- Including sharp gains in efficiency, like DeepSeek and Gemma 3.
- (The apocalyptic trends of GenAI eating all resources don't account for these.)
Bootstrapping starts. GenAI is able to improve itself at a dramatic pace.
GenAI is already better than humans in a lot of verticals.
We and they learn to bridge domains and to arbitrate between different models, depending on which ones are best at solving the problems.
This starts to smell like AGI. (depending on your definition of AGI.)

Meanwhile...
Capitalism is doing its thing.
- Many people are losing their jobs to automation.
- Most of the others are afraid that is going to happen to them.
- The current system is particularly cruel to people who have lost their jobs.
- The Trump administration is busy tearing down the safety nets. 
- Many people who get to keep their jobs find their workload has multiplied incredibly.
This pressure and uncertainty explodes in the streets.

Meanwhile...
Nobody figures out a good way to regulate or constrain GenAI.
Bad actors take open-source GenAI models and go crazy.
But it's an arms race: Good actors manage to neutralize most of these efforts, but not all. 

To overgeneralize, from here there are two paths:
- The system spirals downward out of control into chaos.
- Or we learn to renegotiate the social contract, making room for people who are unemployed, rethinking jobs, and rebuilding trust between workers and managers.

The first path is really, really ugly because our current flavor of capitalism is very unforgiving to people who have lost their jobs.
- Also, it's really hard for somebody who has lost their job to find a new one because they didn't lose their job, they lost their occupation: What they trained for is likely gone for good. They are back at the bottom of the labor pool. 
- It's extremely dicey what thing they should train for next because it might be gone before they actually get trained up. The speed with which tasks are being automated is quicker than the time it takes to qualify a human on those tasks. 
- All of this sews intense anxiety and discontent.
