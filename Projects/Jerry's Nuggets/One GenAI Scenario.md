# One GenAI Scenario 
(draft) 
*How this might play out.* 

Generative AI progress continues.
- Including sharp gains in efficiency.
- (The apocalyptic trends don't account for these)
Bootstrapping starts. GenAI is able to improve itself at a dramatic pace.
GenAI is already better than humans in a lot of verticals.
We and they learn to bridge domains and to arbitrate between different models, depending on which ones are best at solving the problems.
This starts to smell like AGI. (depending on your definition of AGI.)

Meanwhile...
Capitalism is doing its thing.
- Many people are losing their jobs to automation.
- Most of the others are afraid that is going to happen to them.
- The current system is particularly cruel to people who have lost their jobs.
- Many people who get to keep their jobs find their workload has multiplied incredibly.
This pressure and uncertainty explodes in the streets.

From here there are two paths:
- The system spirals downward out of control into chaos.
- Or we learn to renegotiate the social contract, making room for people who are unemployed, rethinking jobs, and rebuilding trust between workers and managers.

The first path is really, really ugly because our current flavor of capitalism is very unforgiving to people who have lost their jobs.
- Also, it's really hard for somebody who has lost their job to find a new one because they didn't lose their job, they lost their occupation. 
- What they trained for is likely gone and it's extremely dicey what thing they should train for next because it might be gone before they actually get trained up. The speed with which tasks are being automated is quicker than the time it takes to qualify a human on those tasks.
