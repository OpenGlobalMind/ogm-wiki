# GenAI Automates Tasks, Not Jobs 
(draft) 
*But knock away enough tasks...* 

In the late 1980s/early 1990s, I was a technology research analyst serving clients in the Advanced Technology Groups of major multinationals. My topic of focus then was neural networks, and in that field, the area of handwriting recognition looked like it might fit neural networks really well. 

Reality proved to be more complicated. Accurate handwriting recognition turned out to be an amalgam of problems, such as ignoring the palm touching the screen; parsing words, then characters; disambiguating between conflicting meanings, etc. Neural nets were a breakthrough for some of those elements, but needed to be integrated with other methods before reliable handwriting reco made it to market. 

More recently, [this article](https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/why-ai-isnt-replacing-radiologists) did a great job of describing the complexities that make it unlikely that radiology will be taken over completely by GenAI. 

When Generative AI achieves parity with an average worker on a given task, the only things keeping it from being automated now are practicalities like: Do we have the time to do the automation? Can we validate the outputs? 

The first such task you successfully automate is likely a small victory. You've mastered this new technology enough to knock out a piece of drudge work. Huzzah! 

If you chose the task wisely, its automation is likely to affect more than one employee. 

On to the next candidate task. And the next. 

Each task that you automate punches a hole in people's job descriptions.
