They all share a particular dependence on trust, an insight it took me over a decade to see and articulate. 

Unfortunately, most systems today are designed from mistrust — and it's quietly breaking our society. This is the story of a solution. 

Somewhere around 2012, it dawned on me that most of my longtime role models and inspirations — the people who innovated the various systems I just listed (and [many more](https://bra.in/4pxQ56)) — had several profound things in common. 

First, I realized that most of my role models were contrarians. They swam against the main stream. Each of the contrarians was carrying a message difficult enough for their peers to hear that they were often marginalized or ridiculed by those peers. Their insights ran against their discipline's standing conventional wisdom: Let *any* worker stop the assembly line? We'll never get anything built! Give people with *no* collateral loans? No way! Let *any fool* on the planet edit the Wikipedia? Are you nuts? *Remove* traffic lights? Seriously? 

You see what I mean. 

Then, slowly, I discovered the thread that connected their initiatives, an approach I called Design from Trust (and abbreviate as DfT). This post is a foundational exposition of DfT. 

**Design from Trust creates systems based on the assumption that participants are responsible and well-intentioned, rather than designing for the worst-case scenario.** Most participants want to enjoy the system's benefits; some would even like to help improve it. Instead of designing systems as if everyone is potentially a bad actor, limiting everyone's behavior and discouraging them from engaging positively, DfT flips the script, and deals with the bad actors later, sometimes cleverly turning them into good actors. 

More importantly, by designing in ways that give the good actors responsibility and leeway, DfT releases the genius that shows up tktk. 

## Trust compounds and rebounds 

Trust has countless facets, from improving interpersonal trust to building high-trust teams, using transparency to increase trust, designing the *appearance* of trust (why bank buildings used to have Greek columns out front and a big, visible safe inside), and revealing and fixing defects in a system to raise long-term trust (versus denying that there's anything wrong). 

The facet that Design from Trust focuses on is systems design as it relates to trust. 

What's crazy about DfT is that redesigning systems in this way has positive effects on many of the other facets: trust compounds and rebounds. For example, empowering everyone to stop the assembly line builds high-trust teams and improves product quality. Hosting Unconferences (instead of programming every moment of an event with famous speakers, fancy panels, and highly facilitated exercises) is a gesture of trust to your participants, and engages them by sharing the responsibility for the event with them. How's that for audience "engagement"? Adopting Open Source software or Workplace Democracy directly increases transparency — and trust. Addressing problems in a system's *design* can resolve "downstream" problems that resist other approaches.  

Most systems telegraph their distrust through their design, through the glaring or subtle elements that tell us to stay in our lane, not question the system, or obey a signal instead of connecting with others. That starts a downward spiral, since many people treated as untrustworthy won't have many reasons to behave better. We respond to the way we are treated. Approach me looking for the best in me and I'll try to live up to your expectations; approach me as if I'm a thief or criminal and I'm likely to disconnect, or worse: fulfill the fears you have telegraphed to me. 

For example, researchers at Boston University Medical Center discovered that [redesigning](https://www.bu.edu/fammed/projectred/) the hospital's discharge process to assume patients wanted to get healthy but got tangled in the many details (as opposed to assuming they were not going to comply) reduced readmissions by 30 percent. 

## Risk is useful 

Modern design seems allergic to risk, perhaps a rational response to a very litigious society. tktktk 

Instead of designing out all risks, Design from Trust harnesses some risks to engage participants and inspire them to contribute significantly to the systems' healthy functioning. For example, if pedestrians, bicyclists and drivers don't slow down, make eye contact, and pace-match through intersections, [[Contrarian Hans Monderman|Traffic Calming]] fails and people get hurt. Yet people step up, figure out their roles, and traffic flows naturally. Similarly, if nobody steps forward at an [[Contrarian Harrison Owen|Unconference]] and names a topic for conversation, there won't be any sessions. Yet they do step forward, and they do engage in conversations that are unusual for highly controlled events. 

Leaving some risk in the system puts some responsibility for the system's success in participants' hands. 

This sharing of risk and responsibility not only works, it transforms participants subtly. The shift from being an audience member to co-creating the event's content and value is a gift of agency, a thing our consumerist, command-and-control world has stolen from us. Letting anyone edit the world's encyclopedia is a way of metaphorically leaving the key in the door, inviting people to help. It is a gesture of trust. As Wikipedia's founder Jimmy Wales puts it in his recent book about trust, tktktktk. 

> *The shift from being an audience member to co-creating the event's content and value is a gift of agency, a thing our consumerist, command-and-control world has stolen from us.* 

I think our souls recognize these gestures of trust and react favorably to them. Our souls are then hungry for a bit more of this elixir, but they don't know where to turn. Design from Trust is the thread that connects these systems, so we can find other systems that share these traits, and even better: so we can redesign dysfunctional systems using consistent principles. 

## History 

Believe it or not, my catalyst for these insights was the single word "[consumer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VfeuITmNUk)." Here's how that story unfolded for me. 

[Somehow](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/projects/jerry's_nuggets/my_story_of_trust), over the past multiple decades (and centuries) and for a variety of reasons, we lost faith in humans. Then we began to design most of our institutions as if everyone was a bad actor. (The "we" I mean is complex, involving many different parties at many different times, each designing, tweaking and implementing the major systems we use every day, from education to transportation, elections, publishing, finance, and more.) 

What's worse, we adapted. We got used to it. We take mistrust completely for granted now. We've normalized it so thoroughly that mistrust is our default setting and [[The 2 Oh Shit!s|we're startled]] when that setting switches. (Years later, I realized that we "[consumerized](https://bra.in/2joMDY)" almost every aspect of our lives.) 

This wasn't always so. Long ago, we figured out [[We Used to Know How to Live in Community on the Commons|how to live in community, on the Commons]]. It was hard-won wisdom, and we've forgotten most of it. 

Actually, we didn't just forget it. We steamrolled it over a couple centuries with the mutually reinforcing dynamics of several isms: colonialism, industrialism, capitalism, consumerism, and modernism. Now we're rugged individuals in the ownership society — treated as [consumers, not citizens](https://bra.in/8vBzBa) — and we wonder why so many of us feel apathetic, disconnected, sad, and powerless. 

Discovering the thread that connects my contrarians brought me to believe not only that we have an opportunity to redesign everything from trust, but that [[Trust Is the (Only) Way Forward|trust is the (only) way forward]]. 

## Reality check

Whoa, whoa, whoa!, I hear your brain say: has Jerry read the news? It seems trust is in tatters these days. Aren't there a lot of bad actors out there? Don't people around the world seem hungrier for change than for trust? Isn't Generative AI making this all more difficult? And how do you scale trust? Isn't Design from Trust the most naïve program anyone's ever put forth? 

I can't blame you for being skeptical. It's certainly time for a reality check in this post, and it's easy to see how DfT might seem an idealist's dream. Allow me to build a case for it. 

First, **Design from Trust is not naïve trust.** The world definitely has bad actors, some of whom are scary smart and well organized. But we shouldn't let them dictate how we design our world, which is somehow where we've ended up. 

When you do meet the bad actors, two points: 1) It's important to know how to defend yourself, which then lets you choose to be undefended (a gesture of trust), not defenseless; and 2) What *some* of the bad actors want is to be heard, or to belong. Design from Trust gives them that, which may help turn them into good actors. 

Second, you may also be thinking: **Trust doesn't scale!** What's true here is that using industrial methods to create trust doesn't scale. We are humans, not robots (yet). Partly, we've lost our perspective on large-scale social trust because we've been designing most everything for efficiency, scale and profit, deprecating meaning, connection, and interdependence. Trust does scale, but it does so organically and adaptively, by giving people design options they opt into and make their own, not by imposing "best practices" (or worse, misguided edicts) from on high. 

People are screaming for change around the world because the current systems aren't giving them a future worth fighting for. The social contract is broken everywhere, and we are [involuntarily renegotiating it](https://bra.in/2jkMaZ). 

Unfortunately, we have little sense of how to make our situations better, because we have completely alienated ourselves from the principles that would help us do so. Our default assumption has become mistrust, which is very corrosive. So instead, [we turn the old dials to 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fbMQ5Z2lN4), adding intensity, surveillance, and laws that make little sense, and then wonder why people are still upset and the statistics don't improve. 

Third, **[[The Alternatives to Sorting Out Trust All Suck|the alternatives to sorting out trust all suck]]**. From assuming that technologists will fix our problems, to donning goggles and living in the Metaverse, or colonizing Mars because we've spoiled our planet, I don't see a plausible, popular vision out there that leads to a society worth loving. Trust offers credible, desirable ways forward. 

And fourth, **in today's geopolitical arena, trust is being undermined relentlessly**. From journalism and science to elections and foreigners, mistrust is rampant. It's a rhetorical war, and trust is losing. 

That's a lot of reality. 

Shifting to the positive, consider the benefits of leveraging authentic trust. 

## Benefits 

Trust: 

- **Is [[Trust Is Cheaper Than Control|cheaper than control]]**: Beyond the costs of surveillance and enforcement, much of people's energy in coercive systems is about avoidance or circumvention. Imagine instead most everyone willingly working toward the systems' goals while trying to improve the system.  
  
- **Connects people, builds community**: Design from Trust usually relies on humans collaborating, and usually in a way that feels good and creates shared assets, such as vacant rooms now available for rent, a World Wide Web that allows for innovation, and curious kids who aspire to be good citizens.  
  
- **Unlocks genius**: Control typically means making sure everyone "swims in their own lane." Having sharp boundaries lets you see who is failing and whom to reward. But it also keeps people from offering the skills that aren't on their job description. 
  
- **Begets [abundance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlo8d7F5hdo)**:  
  
- **Differentiates organizations** (especially in low-trust times): 
  
- **Feels great, even when it's scary**: 

Trust is also fragile. And [[Trust is…|more]]. 

Covering all these benefits in depth would turn this post into a white paper or a book, so as you might imagine, I'll be posting about them, plus the many other issues I'm just brushing in here.

## How

Designing from ([[From Trust, Not For|not for]]) trust usually isn't a patch to existing systems. It requires thoughtful (re)design that follows a set of principles.  

Wikipedia illustrates this need for thoughtful redesign nicely. It wasn't originally a wiki at all. It [[Wikipedia Started as the Nupedia|started life as the Nupedia project]], modeled on traditional publishing. When that effort wasn't working, the project team had a caterpillar-to-butterfly moment that was neither obvious nor easy, but which led to the team's finding a way to the organic, explosive growth that gave us the modern Wikipedia. 

In this case, the inventors of the Wiki did the thoughtful Design from Trust; Wikipedians adopted and inherited it, then enhanced it as they solved problems that smaller wiki sites hadn't yet hit, as well as . 

In Design from Trust, just seeing the contradictions isn't enough. You have to shift your thinking, because from today's default frame of mind, many of the solutions DfT proposes seem counterintuitive or just a bit crazy, as I described earlier. A real shift in your perspective allows you then to shape the new dynamics you want to create, then set it all in motion. 

Underpinning this change model are the [Principles of Design from Trust](https://bra.in/5jkNwq), which start with [[Assume Good Faith]] (or Intent). More on these soon, too. 

Finally, because Design from Trust is the common thread connecting very different movements and industries, your ability to see it improves the more stories you hear of DfT examples. I've started telling these stories [[Introducing My Contrarians|here]] and [[Shorts to Revitalize Cities|here]] and would love to spark others' extending this catalog. 

Storytelling is key to our collective growth. 

## Outcomes 

Design from Trust addresses many topical questions. For example, it can help us: 

- Build authentic, durable trust with our clients and customers (and employees and suppliers). 
- Break the grip of addictive social media and surveillance capitalism. 
- Rebuild trust in institutions (by changing them, not by marketing them better). 
- Retake control over the design of our living spaces and institutions. 
- Bridge the political divides that separate us. 
- Repair our failing systems, from education and governance to health care, urban design and more. 
- Help people connect to meaning and purpose. 
- Help young folk find their way into promising adulthood. 
- Make the best use of Generative AI to create positive futures. 

Lovely, useful ideas spill out when you flip your assumptions about trust, such as [Scarcity = Abundance - Trust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlo8d7F5hdo&feature=youtu.be), [The Joy Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkjEOigXUrk), and, well, Design from Trust itself 😁. 

If we do this right, we might collectively construct a [Betterverse](https://www.thebetterverse.org/). 

Design from Trust isn't a theory waiting to be tested. It's [[Design from Trust Is Widespread Already|already working in the real world]] — you've probably experienced it yourself. The breakthrough isn't inventing it. The breakthrough is recognizing that these seemingly unrelated successes share a common architecture. Once you see it, you can build it anywhere.
