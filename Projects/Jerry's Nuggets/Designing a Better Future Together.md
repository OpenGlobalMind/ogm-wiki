# Designing a Better Future Together
 (draft) 
*Through Design from Trust.* 

What do the following have in common? 
- The Internet 
- [Horse whispering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_horsemanship) 
- [Traffic calming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_calming) 
- [Microfinance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance) 
- [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.com) 
- [Workplace democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_democracy) 
- [Unschooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling) 
- [Unconferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) and the
- [Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System) 

They all share a particular dependence on trust. 

Somewhere around 2012, it dawned on me that many of my longtime role models and inspirations — the people who innovated the various systems I just listed (and [many more](https://bra.in/4pxQ56)) — had several profound things in common. 

First, I realized that many (most?) of my role models were contrarians. Each of the contrarians was carrying a message difficult enough for their peers to hear that they were often marginalized or ridiculed by their peers. Their insights ran against their discipline's standing conventional wisdom: Give people with no collateral loans? No way! Let any fool on the planet edit the Wikipedia? Are you nuts? Remove traffic lights? Seriously? Let any worker stop the assembly line? We'll never get anything built! 

You see what I mean. 

Then, slowly, I discovered the thread that connected their initiatives, which I called Design from Trust (and abbreviate as DfT). 

Any system that has more than two humans in it involves trust, which has countless facets. The facet I'm focusing on with DfT isn't building high-trust teams, or using transparency to increase trust, or revealing and fixing defects in a system to raise long-term trust. Instead, I've been fascinated by this more specific take on trust that has to do with systems design. 
 
What's crazy about Design from Trust is that redesigning systems with it then affects many of the other facets that I just stepped past. For example, empowering everyone to stop the assembly line builds high-trust teams and improves product quality. Hosting Unconferences (instead of programming every moment of an event with famous speakers and fancy panels) is a gesture of trust to your participants. Adopting Open Source software or Workplace Democracy directly increases transparency — and trust. 

**The tl;dr:** Design from Trust redesigns systems from an assumption that most people who will touch the system are good actors. They want to enjoy the system's benefits, and may even wish to help improve it. 

Instead of designing systems as if everyone is a bad actor, DfT flips the script, and deals with the bad actors later. 

## The role of risk 

Instead of designing out all risks, DfT lets some risks engage participants and inspire them to contribute significantly to the systems' healthy functioning. If pedestrians, bicyclists and drivers don't slow down, make eye contact, and pace-match through intersections, Traffic Calming fails. If nobody steps forward at an Unconference and names a topic for conversation, there won't be any sessions. 

Leaving some risk in the system puts some responsibility for the system's success in participants' hands. 

This sharing of risk and responsibility not only works, it transforms participants subtly. The shift from being an audience member to co-creating the event's content and value is a gift of agency, a thing our consumerist, command-and-control world has stolen from us. Letting anyone edit the world's encyclopedia is a way of metaphorically leaving the key in the door, inviting people to help. It is a gesture of trust. 

I think our souls react favorably to these gestures of trust. Our souls are then hungry for a bit more of this elixir, but they don't know where to turn. Design from Trust is the thread that connects these systems so we can find other systems that share these traits, and even better: so we can redesign other systems using the same principles.

## History 

Believe it or not, my catalyst for these insights was the single word "[consumer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VfeuITmNUk)." (Later, I realized we "[consumerized](https://bra.in/2joMDY)" almost every aspect of our lives.) 

[Somehow](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/projects/jerry's_nuggets/my_story_of_trust), over the past multiple decades (and centuries), we lost faith in humans. Then we designed all our institutions as if everyone was a bad actor. 

What's worse, we adapted. We got used to it. We take mistrust completely for granted now. We've normalized it so thoroughly that mistrust is our default setting and [[The 2 Oh Shit!s|we're startled]] when that setting switches. 

This wasn't always so. Long ago, we figured out [[We Used to Know How to Live in Community on the Commons|how to live in community, on the Commons]]. It was hard-won wisdom, and we've forgotten most of it. 

We didn't just forget it. We steamrolled it over a couple centuries with the mutually reinforcing dynamics of several isms: colonialism, industrialism, consumerism, and modernism. Now we're rugged individuals in the ownership society — treated as [consumers, not citizens](https://bra.in/8vBzBa) — and we wonder why so many of us feel apathetic, disconnected and powerless. 

Discovering the thread that connects my contrarians brought me to believe not only that we have an opportunity to redesign everything from trust, but that [[Trust Is the (Only) Way Forward|trust is the (only) way forward]]. 

## Reality check

Whoa, whoa, whoa!, I hear your brain say: has Jerry read the news? It seems trust is in tatters these days. Aren't there bad actors out there? Don't people around the world seem hungrier for change than for trust? Don't trusting societies always lose to violent ones? How do you scale trust? Isn't Design from Trust the most naïve program anyone's ever put forth? 

I can't blame you for being skeptical. It's certainly time for a reality check in this post, and it's easy to see how DfT might seem an idealist's dream. Allow me to build a case for it. 

First, **Design from Trust is not naïve trust.** The world definitely has bad actors, some of whom are really smart and well organized. But we shouldn't let them dictate how we design our world. It's important to know how to defend yourself, which then lets you choose to be undefended, not defenseless. 

Second, you may also be thinking: **Trust doesn't scale!** What's true here is that using industrial methods to create trust doesn't scale. We are humans, not robots (yet). Partly, we've lost our perspective on large-scale social trust because we've been designing for efficiency, scale and profit, deprecating meaning and connection. Trust does scale, but it does so organically and adaptively, by giving people design options they opt into and make their own, not by imposing "best practices" from outside. 

Third, **the alternatives to a trust-based future all suck**. I don't have a rigorous, exhaustive framework that encompasses all futures we face, but the futures on offer today do seem bleak. 

The default path we're on takes us into autocratic surveillance societies, with new intelligences emerging that will be motivated by consumerism instead of social good, plus a high likelihood of self-inflicted, traumatic climate disruptions. 

The [broligarchs](https://bra.in/7j8XRk) who say "[we have to get off this rock!](https://bra.in/3vAB8a)" seem oblivious that trust is essential to becoming a multiplanetary species. Without trust, you don't want to be on the first thousand cramped rockets full of settlers. Besides, there's plenty to do on our lovely planet. 

The "trustless" crypto vision 

Shifting to the positive, consider the benefits of leveraging authentic trust. 

## Benefits 

Trust:
- Is [[Trust Is Cheaper Than Control|cheaper than control]]  
- Connects people, builds community 
- Unlocks genius 
- Begets [abundance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlo8d7F5hdo&feature=youtu.be) 
- Differentiates organizations (especially in low-trust times)
- Feels great (even when it's scary) 

It's also fragile. And [[Trust is…|more]]. 

Covering all these angles in depth would turn this post into a paper or a book, so I'll be writing posts about them all, plus the many other issues I'm just touching on here. Follow or subscribe if you'd like to join the journey. Contact me if you'd like to explore them for your organization. 

## How

Designing from ([[From Trust, Not For|not for]]) trust requires thoughtful (re)design — and a "mirror." You can't just bolt DfT on existing systems and expect it to work.

## Outcomes 

Questions DfT addresses: 

- How might we break the grip of addictive social media and surveillance capitalism? 
- How might we rebuilt trust and retake control over the design of our cities and institutions? 
- 

Lovely ideas spill out when you flip the trust telescope, such as [[Scarcity = Abundance - Trust]] and [[The Joy Line]]. Well, and Design from Trust 😁. 

If we do this right, we might collectively construct a [Betterverse](https://www.thebetterverse.org/).
