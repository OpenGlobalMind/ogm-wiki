- [Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System) 

They all share a particular dependence on trust. 

Somewhere around 2012, it dawned on me that many of my longtime role models and inspirations — the people who innovated the various systems I just listed (and [many more](https://bra.in/4pxQ56)) — had several profound things in common. 

First, I realized that most of my role models were contrarians. Each of the contrarians was carrying a message difficult enough for their peers to hear that they were often marginalized or ridiculed by those peers. Their insights ran against their discipline's standing conventional wisdom: Give people with no collateral loans? No way! Let any fool on the planet edit the Wikipedia? Are you nuts? Remove traffic lights? Seriously? Let any worker stop the assembly line? We'll never get anything built! 

You see what I mean. 

Then, slowly, I discovered the thread that connected their initiatives, which I called Design from Trust (and abbreviate as DfT). 

Any system that has more than two humans in it involves trust, which has countless facets. The facet I'm focusing on with DfT isn't building high-trust teams, or using transparency to increase trust, or revealing and fixing defects in a system to raise long-term trust. Instead, I've been fascinated by this more specific take on trust that has to do with systems design that depends on trust. 
 
What's crazy about Design from Trust is that redesigning systems with it then affects many of the other facets that I just stepped past. For example, empowering everyone to stop the assembly line builds high-trust teams and improves product quality. Hosting Unconferences (instead of programming every moment of an event with famous speakers and fancy panels) is a gesture of trust to your participants, and engages them by sharing the responsibility for the event with them. Adopting Open Source software or Workplace Democracy directly increases transparency — and trust. 

**The tl;dr:** Design from Trust redesigns systems from an assumption that most people who will touch the system are good actors. They want to enjoy the system's benefits, and may even wish to help improve it. 

Instead of designing systems as if everyone is a bad actor, DfT flips the script, and deals with the bad actors later.

## The role of risk 

Instead of designing out all risks, DfT lets some risks engage participants and inspire them to contribute significantly to the systems' healthy functioning. If pedestrians, bicyclists and drivers don't slow down, make eye contact, and pace-match through intersections, Traffic Calming fails. If nobody steps forward at an Unconference and names a topic for conversation, there won't be any sessions. 

Leaving some risk in the system puts some responsibility for the system's success in participants' hands. 

This sharing of risk and responsibility not only works, it transforms participants subtly. The shift from being an audience member to co-creating the event's content and value is a gift of agency, a thing our consumerist, command-and-control world has stolen from us. Letting anyone edit the world's encyclopedia is a way of metaphorically leaving the key in the door, inviting people to help. It is a gesture of trust. 

I think our souls react favorably to these gestures of trust. Our souls are then hungry for a bit more of this elixir, but they don't know where to turn. Design from Trust is the thread that connects these systems so we can find other systems that share these traits, and even better: so we can redesign all systems using the same principles. 

## History 

Believe it or not, my catalyst for these insights was the single word "[consumer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VfeuITmNUk)." (Later, I realized we "[consumerized](https://bra.in/2joMDY)" almost every aspect of our lives.) 

[Somehow](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/projects/jerry's_nuggets/my_story_of_trust), over the past multiple decades (and centuries), we lost faith in humans. Then we designed most of our institutions as if everyone was a bad actor. (The "we" I mean involves many different actors at many different times, collectively designing, tweaking and implementing the major systems we use every day, from education to transportation, elections, publishing and entertainment.)

What's worse, we adapted. We got used to it. We take mistrust completely for granted now. We've normalized it so thoroughly that mistrust is our default setting and [[The 2 Oh Shit!s|we're startled]] when that setting switches. 

This wasn't always so. Long ago, we figured out [[We Used to Know How to Live in Community on the Commons|how to live in community, on the Commons]]. It was hard-won wisdom, and we've forgotten most of it. 

We didn't just forget it. We steamrolled it over a couple centuries with the mutually reinforcing dynamics of several isms: colonialism, industrialism, consumerism, and modernism. Now we're rugged individuals in the ownership society — treated as [consumers, not citizens](https://bra.in/8vBzBa) — and we wonder why so many of us feel apathetic, disconnected and powerless. 

Discovering the thread that connects my contrarians brought me to believe not only that we have an opportunity to redesign everything from trust, but that [[Trust Is the (Only) Way Forward|trust is the (only) way forward]]. 

## Reality check

Whoa, whoa, whoa!, I hear your brain say: has Jerry read the news? It seems trust is in tatters these days. Aren't there bad actors out there? Don't people around the world seem hungrier for change than for trust? Don't trusting societies always lose to violent ones? How do you scale trust? Isn't Design from Trust the most naïve program anyone's ever put forth? 

I can't blame you for being skeptical. It's certainly time for a reality check in this post, and it's easy to see how DfT might seem an idealist's dream. Allow me to build a case for it. 

First, **Design from Trust is not naïve trust.** The world definitely has bad actors, some of whom are really smart and well organized. But we shouldn't let them dictate how we design our world. It's important to know how to defend yourself, which then lets you choose to be undefended (a gesture of trust), not defenseless. 

Second, you may also be thinking: **Trust doesn't scale!** What's true here is that using industrial methods to create trust doesn't scale. We are humans, not robots (yet). Partly, we've lost our perspective on large-scale social trust because we've been designing most everything for efficiency, scale and profit, deprecating meaning and connection. Trust does scale, but it does so organically and adaptively, by giving people design options they opt into and make their own, not by imposing "best practices" from outside. 

Third, **[[The Alternatives to Sorting Out Trust All Suck|the alternatives to sorting out trust all suck]]**. 

Shifting to the positive, consider the benefits of leveraging authentic trust. 

## Benefits 

Trust:
- Is [[Trust Is Cheaper Than Control|cheaper than control]]  
- Connects people, builds community 
- Unlocks genius 
- Begets [abundance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlo8d7F5hdo&feature=youtu.be) 
- Differentiates organizations (especially in low-trust times)
- Feels great, even when it's scary 

It's also fragile. And [[Trust is…|more]]. 

Covering all these angles in depth would turn this post into a paper or a book, so I'll be writing posts about them all, plus the many other issues I'm just touching on here. Follow or subscribe if you'd like to join the journey. [Contact me](mailto:sociate@gmail.com) if you'd like to explore these issues for your organization. 

## How

Designing from ([[From Trust, Not For|not for]]) trust requires thoughtful (re)design — and a "mirror." 

Because it involves trust, you can't just bolt DfT on existing systems and expect it to work, the way you might be able to apply a practice like [Design Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking).  The first problem, which you've likely noticed from everything I've said above, is that we're often blind to the ways in which we're breaking trust. The "mirrors" I just mentioned are other people who are farther down the Design from Trust path than you are, and can point out those hard-to-see contradictions. 

When we *can* see them, many of the solutions DfT proposes seem counterintuitive or downright crazy. 

Shift your way of seeing, then shape.

## Outcomes 

You may have noticed that Design from Trust addresses many topical questions. For example, how might we: 

- Break the grip of addictive social media and surveillance capitalism? 
- Rebuild trust and retake control over the design of our living spaces and institutions? 
- Bridge the political divides that separate us? 
- Repair our failing systems, from education and governance to health care, urban design and more?
- Help people connect to meaning and purpose? 
- Make best use of Generative AI to create positive futures? 

Lovely, useful ideas spill out when you flip the trust telescope, such as [[Scarcity = Abundance - Trust]], [[The Joy Line]], and, well, Design from Trust itself 😁. 

If we do this right, we might collectively construct a [Betterverse](https://www.thebetterverse.org/).
