- [Traffic calming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_calming) and 
- [Unschooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling) 

They all share a particular dependence on trust. 

Somewhere around 2012, it dawned on me that many of my longtime role models and inspirations — the people who innovated the various systems I just listed (and [many more](https://bra.in/4pxQ56)) — had several profound things in common. 

First, I realized that most of my role models were contrarians. Each of the contrarians was carrying a message difficult enough for their peers to hear that they were often marginalized or ridiculed by those peers. Their insights ran against their discipline's standing conventional wisdom: Give people with no collateral loans? No way! Let any fool on the planet edit the Wikipedia? Are you nuts? Remove traffic lights? Seriously? Let any worker stop the assembly line? We'll never get anything built! 

You see what I mean. 

Then, slowly, I discovered the thread that connected their initiatives, which I called Design from Trust (and abbreviate as DfT). 

**Design from Trust redesigns systems from an assumption that most people who will touch the system have good intent.** They want to enjoy the system's benefits, and may even wish to help improve it. Instead of designing systems as if everyone is potentially a bad actor, limiting everyone's behavior and discouraging them from engaging positively, DfT flips the script, and deals with the bad actors later. 

Trust has countless facets, from improving interpersonal trust to building high-trust teams, using transparency to increase trust, designing the *appearance* of trust (why bank buildings used to have Greek columns out front), and revealing and fixing defects in a system to raise long-term trust. The facet that Design from Trust focuses on is systems design that depends on trust. 

What's crazy about DfT is that redesigning systems with it has positive effects on many of the other facets: trust compounds and rebounds. For example, empowering everyone to stop the assembly line builds high-trust teams and improves product quality. Hosting Unconferences (instead of programming every moment of an event with famous speakers, fancy panels, and highly facilitated exercises) is a gesture of trust to your participants, and engages them by sharing the responsibility for the event with them. Adopting Open Source software or Workplace Democracy directly increases transparency — and trust. Addressing problems in a system's *design* can resolve problems that are "downstream." 

Most systems telegraph their distrust through their design, through the glaring or subtle elements that tell us to stay in our lane, not question the system, or obey a signal instead of connecting with others. That starts a downward spiral, since many people treated as untrustworthy won't have many reasons to behave better. We respond to the way we are treated. Approach me looking for the best in me and I'll try to live up to your expectations; approach me as if I'm a thief or criminal and I'm likely to disconnect, or worse. 

## The role of risk 

Instead of designing out all risks, Design from Trust lets some risks engage participants and inspire them to contribute significantly to the systems' healthy functioning. For example, if pedestrians, bicyclists and drivers don't slow down, make eye contact, and pace-match through intersections, [[Contrarian Hans Monderman|Traffic Calming]] fails and people get hurt. Yet they do those things. If nobody steps forward at an [[Contrarian Harrison Owen|Unconference]] and names a topic for conversation, there won't be any sessions. Yet they do step forward. 

Leaving some risk in the system puts some responsibility for the system's success in participants' hands. 

This sharing of risk and responsibility not only works, it transforms participants subtly. The shift from being an audience member to co-creating the event's content and value is a gift of agency, a thing our consumerist, command-and-control world has stolen from us. Letting anyone edit the world's encyclopedia is a way of metaphorically leaving the key in the door, inviting people to help. It is a gesture of trust. 

> *The shift from being an audience member to co-creating the event's content and value is a gift of agency, a thing our consumerist, command-and-control world has stolen from us.* 

I think our souls react favorably to these gestures of trust. Our souls are then hungry for a bit more of this elixir, but they don't know where to turn. Design from Trust is the thread that connects these systems so we can find other systems that share these traits, and even better: so we can redesign all systems using the same principles. 

## History 

Believe it or not, my catalyst for these insights was the single word "[consumer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VfeuITmNUk)." 

[Somehow](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/projects/jerry's_nuggets/my_story_of_trust), over the past multiple decades (and centuries), we lost faith in humans. Then we designed most of our institutions as if everyone was a bad actor. (The "we" I mean is complex, and involves many different actors at many different times, collectively designing, tweaking and implementing the major systems we use every day, from education to transportation, elections, publishing, entertainment, and more.) 

What's worse, we adapted. We got used to it. We take mistrust completely for granted now. We've normalized it so thoroughly that mistrust is our default setting and [[The 2 Oh Shit!s|we're startled]] when that setting switches. (Years later, I realized that we "[consumerized](https://bra.in/2joMDY)" almost every aspect of our lives.) 

This wasn't always so. Long ago, we figured out [[We Used to Know How to Live in Community on the Commons|how to live in community, on the Commons]]. It was hard-won wisdom, and we've forgotten most of it. 

Actually, we didn't just forget it. We steamrolled it over a couple centuries with the mutually reinforcing dynamics of several isms: colonialism, industrialism, capitalism, consumerism, and modernism. Now we're rugged individuals in the ownership society — treated as [consumers, not citizens](https://bra.in/8vBzBa) — and we wonder why so many of us feel apathetic, disconnected, sad, and powerless. 

Discovering the thread that connects my contrarians brought me to believe not only that we have an opportunity to redesign everything from trust, but that [[Trust Is the (Only) Way Forward|trust is the (only) way forward]]. 

## Reality check

Whoa, whoa, whoa!, I hear your brain say: has Jerry read the news? It seems trust is in tatters these days. Aren't there bad actors out there? Don't people around the world seem hungrier for change than for trust? Don't trusting societies always lose to violent ones? Isn't Generative AI making this all more difficult? And how do you scale trust? Isn't Design from Trust the most naïve program anyone's ever put forth? 

I can't blame you for being skeptical. It's certainly time for a reality check in this post, and it's easy to see how DfT might seem an idealist's dream. Allow me to build a case for it. 

First, **Design from Trust is not naïve trust.** The world definitely has bad actors, some of whom are really smart and well organized. But we shouldn't let them dictate how we design our world. It's important to know how to defend yourself, which then lets you choose to be undefended (a gesture of trust), not defenseless. Also, what *some* of the bad actors want is to be heard, or to belong. Design from Trust gives them that, which may help turn them into good actors. 

Second, you may also be thinking: **Trust doesn't scale!** What's true here is that using industrial methods to create trust doesn't scale. We are humans, not robots (yet). Partly, we've lost our perspective on large-scale social trust because we've been designing most everything for efficiency, scale and profit, deprecating meaning and connection. Trust does scale, but it does so organically and adaptively, by giving people design options they opt into and make their own, not by imposing "best practices" from outside. 

Third, **[[The Alternatives to Sorting Out Trust All Suck|the alternatives to sorting out trust all suck]]**. From relying on technologists to fix our problems to donning goggles and living in the Metaverse or colonizing Mars because we've spoiled our planet, I don't see a plausible, popular vision out there that leads to a society worth loving. 

Shifting to the positive, consider the benefits of leveraging authentic trust. 

## Benefits 

Trust:
- Is [[Trust Is Cheaper Than Control|cheaper than control]]  
- Connects people, builds community 
- Unlocks genius 
- Begets [abundance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlo8d7F5hdo) 
- Differentiates organizations (especially in low-trust times)
- Feels great, even when it's scary 

It's also fragile. And [[Trust is…|more]]. 

Covering all these angles in depth would turn this post into a paper or a book, so I'll be writing posts about them all, plus the many other issues I'm just brushing here.

## How

Designing from ([[From Trust, Not For|not for]]) trust usually isn't a patch to existing systems. It requires thoughtful (re)design — and a "mirror" — as well as following a set of principles.  

Wikipedia illustrates this need for thoughtful redesign nicely. It wasn't originally a wiki at all. It [[Wikipedia Started as the Nupedia|started life as the Nupedia project]], modeled on traditional publishing. When that effort wasn't working, the project team had a caterpillar-to-butterfly moment that was neither obvious nor easy, but which led to the team's finding a way to the organic, explosive growth that gave us the modern Wikipedia. 

In this case, the inventors of Wikis did the thoughtful Design from Trust; Wikipedians adopted and inherited it, then enhanced it as they solved problems that smaller wiki sites hadn't yet hit. 

About those "mirrors...."

Because it involves trust, you can't just bolt Design from Trust onto existing systems and expect it to work. It needs a feedback loop from experienced guides I think of as "mirrors," because one of their more important tasks is to reflect things back that you may not want to see. These mirrors might be experienced DfT facilitators, or perhaps just other people who are ahead of you on the Design from Trust path, and can point out those hard-to-see contradictions. 

Mirrors are necessary because we're often blind to the ways in which we're breaking trust, in large part because we've normalized those practices. For example, we think of advertising as a very normal part of many business models, so much so that ads fuel several of the largest, most influential companies on the planet. Alas, advertising bakes in multiple breaches of trust: companies dumpster-dive our data, analyze it to discover what causes us to buy, then fill our world with offers and enticements, often (usually?) for things we don't need. And we've normalized it. 

In contrast, [Design Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking), which predates Design from Trust, doesn't need mirrors because it relies on empathic observation and rapid prototyping. You can train groups in practically any setting to use Design Thinking, and they will produce interesting results... but likely not transformative results, and sometimes results that reinforce existing dysfunctions. 

Design from Trust brings Design Thinking the moral compass that it lacks.  

In Design from Trust, just **seeing** the contradictions isn't enough. You have to **shift** your thinking, because from today's default frame of mind, many of the solutions DfT proposes seem counterintuitive or downright crazy, as I described earlier. A real shift allows you then to **shape** the new dynamics you want to create, then **set** it all in motion. More on this "4S" (See • Shift • Shape • Set) process in future posts. 

Underpinning the 4S change model are the [Principles of Design from Trust](https://bra.in/5jkNwq), which start with [[Assume Good Faith]] (or Intent). More on these soon, too. 

Finally, because Design from Trust is the common thread connecting very different movements and industries, your ability to see it improves the more stories you hear of DfT examples. I've started telling these stories [[Introducing My Contrarians|here]] and [[Shorts to Revitalize Cities|here]] and would love to spark others' extending this catalog. 

Storytelling is key to our collective growth. 

## Outcomes 

Design from Trust addresses many topical questions. For example, it can help us: 

- Build authentic, durable trust with our clients and customers (and employees and suppliers). 
- Break the grip of addictive social media and surveillance capitalism. 
- Rebuild trust in institutions (by changing them, not by marketing them better). 
- Retake control over the design of our living spaces and institutions. 
- Bridge the political divides that separate us. 
- Repair our failing systems, from education and governance to health care, urban design and more. 
- Help people connect to meaning and purpose. 
- Help young folk find their way into promising adulthood. 
- Make the best use of Generative AI to create positive futures. 

Lovely, useful ideas spill out when you flip your assumptions about trust, such as [Scarcity = Abundance - Trust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlo8d7F5hdo&feature=youtu.be), [The Joy Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkjEOigXUrk), and, well, Design from Trust itself 😁. 

If we do this right, we might collectively construct a [Betterverse](https://www.thebetterverse.org/). 

## Where to

Design from Trust [[Design from Trust Is Widespread Already|already exists in the world]], just not under this name. 

DfT isn't yet a book, a methodology, or a workshop, but it wants to be all of these.
