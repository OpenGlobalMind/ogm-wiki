# Designing a Better Future Together
 (draft) 
*Through Design from Trust.* 

What do the following have in common? 
- [Horse whispering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_horsemanship) 
- [Traffic calming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_calming) 
- [Microfinance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance) 
- [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.com) 
- [Workplace democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_democracy) 
- [Unschooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling) 
- [Unconferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) and the
- [Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System) 

They all share a dependence on trust. 

The idea for Design from Trust lit up in my brain around 2012, when I realized that many of my longtime role models — the people who innovated the things I listed above — had a couple profound things in common. 

First, I realized most of them were contrarians. The message they were carrying was difficult enough for their peers to hear that they were often dissed or marginalized in their disciplines. Give people with no collateral loans? No way! Let any fool on the planet edit the Wikipedia? Are you nuts? Remove traffic lights? Seriously? You see what I mean. 

Then I found the thread that connected their initiatives: trust. Now, trust is involved in any system that has more than two humans in it, so I don't mean trust broadly, but rather a more specific take on it that I came to call Design from Trust. 

tl;dr 

Believe it or not, my catalyst for insight was the word "consumer." 

Somehow, over the past multiple decades, we lost faith in humans. Then we designed all our institutions as if everyone was a bad actor. 

This wasn't always so. Long ago, we figured out how to live in community, on the Commons. 

Not naïve trust. 

Reality check. 

It seems trust is in tatters these days. 

But trust:
- Is cheaper than control 
- Builds community 
- Unlocks our genius 
- Begets abundance 
- Feels great 

Requires thoughtful design. 

Principles of DfT. 

Trust is the (only) way forward. We have an opportunity to redesign everything from trust. 

If we do this right, we might get a [Betterverse](https://www.thebetterverse.org/).
