# Designing a Better Future Together
 (draft) 
*Through Design from Trust.* 

It seems trust is in tatters these days. 

What do the following have in common? 

The idea for DfT lit up in my brain around 2012, when I realized that many of my role models had something interesting in common. I found the thread that connected these initiatives. My catalyst for insight was the word "consumer." 

Somehow, over the past multiple decades, we lost faith in humans. Then we designed all our institutions as if everyone was a bad actor. 

This wasn't always so. Long ago, we figured out how to live in community, on the Commons. 

Not na√Øve trust. 

Reality check. 

But trust:
- Is cheaper than control
- Unlocks our genius 
- Begets abundance 

Principles of DfT. 

Trust is the (only) way forward. We have an opportunity to redesign everything from trust.
