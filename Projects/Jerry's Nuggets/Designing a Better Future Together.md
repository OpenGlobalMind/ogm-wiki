*Through Design from Trust.* 

What do the following have in common? 
- [Horse whispering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_horsemanship) 
- [Traffic calming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_calming) 
- [Microfinance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance) 
- [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.com) 
- [Workplace democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_democracy) 
- [Unschooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling) 
- [Unconferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) and the
- [Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System) 

They all share a particular dependence on trust. 

Somewhere around 2012, it dawned on me that many of my longtime role models and inspirations — the people who innovated the various systems I just listed (and [many more](https://bra.in/4pxQ56)) — had several profound things in common. 

First, I realized most of them were contrarians. Each of them was carrying a message difficult enough for their peers to hear that they were often marginalized or ridiculed by their peers. Their insights ran against their discipline's standing conventional wisdom. Give people with no collateral loans? No way! Let any fool on the planet edit the Wikipedia? Are you nuts? Remove traffic lights? Seriously? Let any worker stop the assembly line? We'll never get anything built! 

You see what I mean. 

Then I discovered the thread that connected their initiatives, which I called Design from Trust. 

 Any system that has more than two humans in it involves trust, which has countless facets. The facet I'm focusing on here isn't building high-trust teams, or using transparency to increase trust, or tktktk. Instead, I've been fascinated by a more specific take on trust that has to do with systems design. What's crazy about it is that it then affects many of the other facets. 

The tl;dr: Design from Trust redesigns systems from an assumption that most people who will touch the system are good actors. They want to enjoy the system, and may even wish to improve it.

## History 

Believe it or not, my catalyst for these insights was the single word "[consumer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VfeuITmNUk)." 

[Somehow](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/projects/jerry's_nuggets/my_story_of_trust), over the past multiple decades (and centuries), we lost faith in humans. Then we designed all our institutions as if everyone was a bad actor. 

What's worse, we adapted, we got used to it. We take mistrust completely for granted now. We've normalized it so well that mistrust is the default setting and we're startled when that setting switches. 

This wasn't always so. Long ago, we figured out [[We Used to Know How to Live in Community on the Commons|how to live in community, on the Commons]]. It was hard-won wisdom, and we've forgotten most of it. 

## Reality 

Not naïve trust. 

Reality check. 

It seems trust is in tatters these days. 

## Benefits 

But trust:
- Is [[Trust Is Cheaper Than Control|cheaper than control]]  
- Builds community 
- Unlocks genius 
- Begets [abundance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlo8d7F5hdo&feature=youtu.be) 
- Differentiates you (especially in low-trust times)
- Feels great (even when it's scary) 

It's also fragile. And [[Trust is…|more]]. 

## How

Designing from ([[From Trust, Not For|not for]]) trust requires thoughtful (re)design and a "mirror." You can't just bolt it on existing systems and expect it to work. 

Building on the [Principles of Design from Trust](https://bra.in/5jkNwq), tktktk. 

## Outcomes 

Lovely ideas spill out when you flip the trust telescope, such as [[Scarcity = Abundance - Trust]] and [[The Joy Line]]. Well, and Design from Trust 😁. 

[[Trust Is the (Only) Way Forward|Trust is the (only) way forward]]. We have an opportunity to redesign everything from trust. 

If we do this right, we might collectively construct a [Betterverse](https://www.thebetterverse.org/).
