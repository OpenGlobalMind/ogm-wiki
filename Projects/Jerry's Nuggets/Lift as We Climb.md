# Lift as We Climb

Suffragist and Civil Rights activist [Mary Church Terrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Church_Terrell) fought Jim Crow laws across the US South. One of her sayings, "lifting as we climb," is a terrific way of expanding the reach and equity of any beneficial movement. 

This is one of the [[Principles of Design from Trust]]. 

Lifting as we climb is also central to the practice of [[Upkido]].
