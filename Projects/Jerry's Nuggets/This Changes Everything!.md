# This Changes Everything!

For many years, the tech business has been distracting you with promises of utopia. 

Personal computers, the Internet, the Web and Smartphones were all real and huge, if perhaps they missed bringing Utopia closer. 

But many other themes fell way short. Remember:

- [[The Internet of Things]] (IoT) 
- [[5G, 6G... Now 10G]]??? 
- [[The Fourth Industrial Revolution]] 
- [[Humanoid Robots]] 
- [[The Crypto Craze]] 
- [[The Metaverse]] 
- [[Spatial Computing]] 

Most of these were big distractions. If you spent time learning about them, then spent money implementing them, chances are you didn't get far and wasted considerable resources. 

I want to apologize on behalf of the tech industry, which gets pretty excited pretty often, not always about the right things. 

Now Generative AI joins this list. GenAI is different. 

GenAI Is the Real Deal. 

Next question: [[Will GenAI Survive Capitalism]]?
