# Trust Is Participatory

This is one of the [[Principles of Design from Trust]]. It may be superfluous. 

It seems to echo: 

- [[Nothing About Us Without Us]] 
- [[Subsidiarity]] 
- [[We're Citizens, Not Consumers]] 
- [[Lift as We Climb]] 
- [[Assume Good Faith]] and 
- [[Be Undefended, Not Defenseless]] 

But maybe what it does is tie them together. 

Trust is a social phenomenon. A person marooned on an island might need to trust that they know enough to stay alive, and that ships might come near their island, plus other things like that. But that's not the kind of trust we're talking about here.
