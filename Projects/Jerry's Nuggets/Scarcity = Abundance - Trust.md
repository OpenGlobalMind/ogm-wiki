(draft) 
*How Commons turn into commodities.*

     Scarcity = Abundance - Trust

So I thought I'd take a moment to explain it better.

To start, here's a virtual talk I gave in the Early Pandemic for the [ExO](https://web.openexo.com/begin-your-transformation/) community.

I've put the video's transcript [[Scarcity = Abundance - Trust (transcript)|here]]. See it in full context in my Brain, [here](https://bra.in/4p6QZP).
