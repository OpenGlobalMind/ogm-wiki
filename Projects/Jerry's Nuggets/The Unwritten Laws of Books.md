# The Unwritten "Laws" of Books

This is a list of norms that we take for granted around books. They are invisible constraints on what books contain, or what they are meant to achieve. 

We'd love to hear your comments and additions. 

All the Material in a Book Must Be Original Content
[[Books May Not Share Chapters]] 
Books that Are too Long (over 200 pages?) Won’t Sell
We Overprotect the Ideas in Books
Books Don’t Make It Easy to Talk with Authors or Other Fans
Books Don’t Get Updated Much, if at All
