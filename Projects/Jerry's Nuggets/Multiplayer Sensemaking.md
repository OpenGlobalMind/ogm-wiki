# Multiplayer Sensemaking

Most [[Tools for Thinking]] are single-player: they are notetaking, map-making or data-visualizing tools that help one person organize their thinking. Most users of these tools are creating private notes. 

A few tools are designed to help groups do sensemaking. Very few tools are designed to interact with other tools. 

Deep multiplayer sensemaking likely involves this heterogeneous cooperation. In fact to build a rich sensemaking Commons, we have to convince:
- toolmakers to make tools that make sharing easier, and
- tool user to share much more often.
