# The Fungus Manifesto

Problem:

- Drowning in the info-flood
- We don't know what we know
- Overprotecting IP
	- Ideas are trapped
	- We lack tools for building context/stocks
- All our reading lists are stacked too high
- We have an opportunity to build knowledge together (not just an encyclopedia)
- Narratives are important

We can save the world if we help people share what they know and sort it out productively. 

Wikipedia as base. 

This helps these people do what?
