# Ida and Jerry Explore Unlocking Human Potential

Ida Josefiina is the founder of [Sane](https://www.sane.fyi/). I'm the founder of Open Global Mind and curator of the world's largest public, hand-made mind map: bra.in/jerry 

We recently met over Zoom to talk about how Generative AI and collective sensemaking tools, used well together, could really level up humanity's game. In the process, we wandered through:

- creativity over productivity, 
- Techno-Optimism vs Cosmic Positivism, 
- individuals vs the collective, 
- meditation as technology, 
- how to help ideas do their work in the world, and more. 

Here's our conversation on YouTube:
