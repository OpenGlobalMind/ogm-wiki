# Ida and Jerry Explore Unlocking Human Potential

Ida Josefiina is the founder of [Sane](https://www.sane.fyi/). I'm the founder of Open Global Mind and curator of the world's largest public, hand-made mind map: bra.in/jerry 

We recently met over Zoom to talk about how Generative AI and collective sensemaking tools, used well together, could really level up humanity's game. We wandered through:
- creativity over productivity, 
- Techno-Optimism vs Cosmic Positivism, 
- individuals vs the collective, 
- meditation as technology, 
- how to help ideas do their work in the world, and more. 

Here's the call:
