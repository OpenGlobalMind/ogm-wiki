# Contrarian: John Taylor Gatto
(draft) 
*Kids are naturally curious. Why do we stamp it out?*  

You'll find context for this post, which is part of a short series, [[Introducing My Contrarians|here]]. 

Gatto is one of the crustiest contrarians I've had the pleasure to meet. He also opened my eyes to the genius in kids and the flawed design of our compulsory education system.

Not that we should put all kids on warships, or even in the labor force at 9 or 10. But...

The way Gatto won teaching prizes was by breaking many of the rules, though he wasn't saying that out loud. He would send his students to empty classrooms to work, unchaperoned. He had them in the streets of New York, selling ad space to merchants in the newspaper they were creating. 

When higher-ups started to send observers into his classrooms, he lost the the wiggle room to break those rules that obscurity gave him. Frustrated, he quit teaching and wrote [this op-ed](https://saintkosmas.org/gatto-i-quit-i-think) for the Wall Street Journal to describe why, then spent the rest of his life trying to convince everyone to trust children to be curious. It saddens me that that was his heresy. 

If you read Gatto's Underground History, 

[[The Hidden Curriculum of School]]. 

Here's how I described Gatto's work at U22:

Next up: Contrarian Christopher Alexander. 

As you'll see in this short series, Contrarians are masters of [[Rethink Constraints|rethinking constraints]]. They are also the foundations of [[Design from Trust]]. 

If you read this far, a treat: In [my online Brain](https://www.jerrysbrain.com/), you'll find all my Contrarians [here](https://bra.in/4jrdQp), where you can see them in their greater context.
