# Snip! On the Origins of the Global Financial Crisis
(draft) 
*Severing ties to long-term outcomes ends badly.*

Early in our Pandemic, compelled by a series of ideas that clicked together in my (wet, onboard, organic) brain, I created three videos to explain how we got into the [Global Financial Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis) of 2008-2009, also known as the Subprime Crisis. 

Here's the tl;dr:

- Many different parties at many different times "snipped" the long-term relations that held the financial system together. For example: 
	- Bankers who knew and helped their clients (think Jimmy Stewart in [It's a Wonderful Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_a_Wonderful_Life)) through the life of a loan got replaced by transactional layers (loan originators immediately sell mortgages to securities houses, which dice and package them up into hybrid securities, which are largely unrecognizeable) and nearly incomprehensible exotic securities. 
	- The ratings houses â€” Moody's, Fitch, and Standard & Poors â€” started rating most anything as AAA (least risk), fearing the next house would say yes if they said no. 
	- The major investment banks â€” Salomon, Lehman and Goldman â€” went public. Instead of being partnerships where partners' reputations and assets were on the line, long term, they were now playing with [OPM](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=OPM). 
	- "Foreclosure Phil" Gramm and others got rid of [Glass-Steagall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_legislation), allowing all banks to speculate. 
- Because they were based on flawed assumptions, the exotic derivatives offered juicy returns. 
- Everyone wanted their money invested in these juicy, exotic instruments. Not joining that crowd on this merry-go-round brought you a lot of heat and hate (read or watch The Big Short). 
- When the system collapsed, the big fish who jumped off the merry-go-round profited nicely; everyone else got hosed. 

Okay, not the shortest tl;dr ever ðŸ˜…
