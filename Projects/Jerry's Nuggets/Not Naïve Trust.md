# Not Naïve Trust
 (draft) 
*We're not all trustworthy, but we're definitely not all bad actors.* 

In simpler times, when we lived in villages and didn't travel much from them, we grew up knowing whom to trust and not to trust. A few people still live in villages like that, but for most humans, those times are long past, and as a result, we've had to figure out how to deal with strangers. 

We — a complicated, collective we, crusty with time — designed most of our institutions around the assumption that pretty much everyone might be a bad actor. As a result, we created systems that invite mistrust, disconnect us from responsibility and one another, and have been dragging civilization down. 

[[Design from Trust]] is interesting and necessary because it seems we took this opposite path. 

There are bad actors. 

Design from Trust is not meant to imply that one should give blind trust to everyone, or that naïve trust is the way to go. Far from it. 

Here's what I posted in 2016:

Not Naïve Trust pairs nicely with [[Be Undefended, Not Defenseless]] and [[Design from Trust Requires Thoughtful Design]].
