# The Big Fungus

Why a Big Fungus? 

![[Fabulous Fungal Metaphors]]

Now a narrative to weave these metaphors:

Think of The Big Fungus as a layer of assertions and opinions above Google and Wikipedia, part of [[Data Is the New Soil]]. 

So how might some of us curate The Big Fungus together? See [[The Fungus Manifesto]].

Of course, we have a fledgling website devoted to [The Big Fungus](https://www.thebigfungus.org/). 

[[FungusTech]] is what we call the code and collaborations we'll need to help The Big Fungus flourish. 

A different metaphor for similar reasons: [[The Betterverse]].
