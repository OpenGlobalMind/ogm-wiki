# The Big Fungus

Why a Big Fungus? 

Fungi offer rich, evocative, funny metaphors about symbiosis and collaboration in nature, which fit our mission at Open Global Mind to create a shared, interconnected memory for humans in multiple ways, including:

- [[Mycelia in the Wood Wide Web]]
- [[Leaf-Cutter Ants Can't Digest Leaves]]. So Why Are They Taking Leaves to Their Nests?
- [[Mushrooms Externalize Their Digestion]]
- [[Fungi are the Principal Decomposers in Ecological Systems]]
- [[Mushrooms for Bioremediation]]
- [[Mushrooms Are the Fruiting Bodies of Mycelium]], (so [[NeoBooks are Mushrooms of The Big Fungus]])
- [[Hyphae Connect]]
- [[Fungi Can Be Huge]]
- [[The Matsutake's Peculiar Ecosystem]]
- [[Magic Mushrooms]]
- [[Data as Healthy Soil]]

Now a narrative to weave these metaphors:

Think of The Big Fungus as a layer of assertions and opinions above Google and Wikipedia, part of [[Data Is the New Soil]]. 

So how might some of us curate The Big Fungus together? See [[The Fungus Manifesto]].

Of course, we have a fledgling website devoted to [The Big Fungus](https://www.thebigfungus.org/). 

[[FungusTech]] is what we call the code and collaborations we'll need to help The Big Fungus flourish. 

A different metaphor for similar reasons: [[The Betterverse]].
