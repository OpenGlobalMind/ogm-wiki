# Behind the Reel: The Joy Line
(draft) 
[My speaker's reel](https://vimeo.com/1006299404?share=copy) contains many fleeting moments that are really significant to me, so I'm elaborating on them in a quick series of posts. 

At [2:52 in the reel](https://vimeo.com/1006299404?share=copy#t=172.638) I mention two projects in passing, neither of which made the cut for deeper explanation in the reel: Design from Trust, which I'll return to in a future post, and The Joy Line, which I'll turn to here.
