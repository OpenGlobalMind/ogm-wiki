# A Worldview Built from Contrarians (U22 Talk)
(draft) 
In October 2022, I gave a keynote talk in Bucharest, Romania, at [Unfinished 2022](https://archive.unfinished.ro/2022/) (U22). You can watch the whole talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N47GRiYZ0p8), and see it in context in my Brain [here](https://bra.in/4jXD9y). 

This talk is essentially the backstory of how I came up with the ideas that I expressed virtually at U20 in [[Trust Is the (Only) Way Forward]]. 

[[Nuggetization|Nuggetizing]] the talk yields: 

The Itch
The Contrarians
Harrison Owen
Hans Monderman
Eleanor Ostrom
John Taylor Gatto
Admiral Farragut
The Hidden Curriculum of School
Christopher Alexander
Pattern Languages
Contrarian inspirations
Contrarians vs kooks?
Defenseless vs undefended
Awareness milestones
Conclusions
A policy platform
How should we start?
How did everything break?
Why is solving things difficult?
