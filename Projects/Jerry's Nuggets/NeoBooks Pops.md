# NeoBooks Pops!

How about we experiment with helping one another improve our posts, then get attention for them? 

How about we do this in the near term with the US Election as our goal? 

In Social Media's salad days, some folks came up with the notion of a "thunderclap," in which a group would swap social media contact info, then focus on one post to like, share, retweet (was Twitter a thing then?), etc. The idea is to generate a bunch of attention for one post at one moment, and it worked well enough that a company emerged called [Thunderclap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderclap_(website)) that did this in a more corporate way. 

We'd like to experiment with that attention-getting process, plus the earlier step of reviewing and improving one another's posts.
 
## Steps 

So write a draft post somewhere (Medium, Substack, Google Docs) and share it with us. Please use [this form](https://forms.gle/xrPNrRi23Y92nFoR7) to submit your post for consideration. That will put your post on this list:

Whoever comes to the [[NeoBooks Introduction|NeoBooks]] calls will collectively choose whose draft to focus on each week. We'll get through as many as time permits. 

The NeoBooks calls are on Mondays at 10:30am PT for 90 minutes (Zoom is [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/4154650256?pwd=Zm5DWGRJcmFmZGtBMmI1Wkx2WUQyZz09)). We'll be devoting many (but not all) of them to this Pops! project. 

Because there's a Monster Election on the horizon that might affect not only our lives but those of our offspring, we'll focus on that topic. 

That doesn't mean that all posts have to be predictions of how a vote will go, or arguments about the left-right divide. In fact, we'd love to see posts that disrupt the current framing of the Election. Go crazy! Submit your ideas, and let us all help one another.
