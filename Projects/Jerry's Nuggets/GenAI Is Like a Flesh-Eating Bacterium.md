# GenAI Is Like a Flesh-Eating Bacterium
(draft) 
*How this wave of innovation isn't like the others.* 

Before diving in, a declaration: I love what Generative AI is capable of doing, and am optimistic we can figure out how to use it intelligently.

The huge wave of innovation around Generative AI has led to many conjectures about how it will [affect employment](https://bra.in/8j8nDb). Opinions range from GenAI [just being a "normal" technology](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology) (so don't worry!), to it heralding the advent of [Fully Automated Luxury Communism](https://www.amazon.com/Fully-Automated-Luxury-Communism-Bastani-ebook/dp/B075WCGJDW/jerrymichalskisr) (less likely than pigs flying), to GenAI catalyzing a general economic meltdown. 

It's this last extreme possibility that has me worried, for several reasons. The reason I'll cover here is that the GenAI revolution isn't like previous revolutions. 

## There are always new jobs! 

In the 90s, I got a cold call from a researcher who was investigating the future of paper. When we talked, [Adina Levin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adina-levin-b771/), who became a good friend, proceeded to ask me great questions, which I tried to answer to the best my perspective allowed. Each time I thought she was done asking questions, she'd ask another good one. 

Our conversation made me notice that the "paperless society" was a mirage on the horizon: every time we'd wipe out one use of paper (sent a paper check recently?), another would pop up. If you look back at the Amazonification of shopping, you'll wish you'd invested in cardboard. 

Conventional wisdom is that every prior wave of automation or innovation wiped out some jobs, but created new ones. Cars obsoleted blacksmiths (and many other trades), but brought gas stations, auto repair shops and more. Airlines wiped out rail and ship travel (well, in the US), but took us farther, faster than ever, while employing quite a few people. The printing press wiped out scribes, but certainly fed many new industries, plus a few wars and revolutions. Electric lights wiped out lamplighters, candle makers and a few whalers, but ushered in a transformative wave of industrialization and allowed us to turn night back into day. 

Each of these revolutions fueled a new replacement market. 

## This time is different

The thing that's different this time is that when GenAI masters a task — say consolidating regional sales spreadsheets and writing a summary report — that task disappears into the machine. It no longer needs to be done by humans. (Though someone should check the results — for now.) The task is still being done, at lower cost, but it doesn't spawn a new task to offset the work loss. 

GenAI can "eat" tasks the way that necrotizing fasciitis eats human flesh. Alas , the metaphor is memorable but imperfect: it turns out the bacteria that we call flesh-eating don't bite: they secrete toxins that kill off human cells, making a very deadly mess. No chewing involved. But I bet the metaphor stays with you a while. 

It feels almost cliché to  cite Taleb’s Black Swan these days, but you may remember that he describes how every day is great for the turkey up until Thanksgiving time. He just doesn’t see it coming: 

> Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird’s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race “looking out for its best interests,” as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief. (The Black Swan)

I have a feeling this is one of those moments for us. 

This process is happening so quickly that organizations likely don't have a good picture of the extent of the change. Also, so-called [Shadow AI](Shadow AI) masks much of the damage, because employees use the technology but don't say they did. 

As GenAI spreads unchecked through organizations, it is tearing holes in the workforce. But because [[GenAI Automates Tasks, Not Jobs]] (so far), tktktk. 

A reasonable counter argument is that the new wave of future jobs aren't evident to those whose jobs are about to be wiped out. Blacksmiths couldn't foresee tire busters. Looking higher in the transportation system's effects, the remaking of cities around cars and the effects of the Interstate Highway System were in few people's imaginations. 

If such a thing comes to pass around GenAI, I do not promise to eat my hat, but I will be very surprised. 

## John Henry, with complications  

In the race between humans and machine intelligence, machine intelligence has huge advantages. Humans, as they age, get a bit smarter, but also get more expensive. They want raises. They are hard to manage. They earn longer vacations. Machine intelligence just gets faster cheaper better. 

For years, well before the advent of GenAI, senior executives have been assiduous in their efforts to get rid of full-time human employees. From [zero-hour contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-hour_contract) to turning employees into "independent contractors," inescapable part-time status, [contingent faculty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjunct_professor) in higher education, to Business Process Reengineering (ah, remember the 90s?), the trend is [everywhere](https://bra.in/2pxo6v). 

Now there's a fancy new power tool on deck, and it has really sharp blades. 

This post leaves several juicy nuggets on the table that are fodder for future posts: 

- How will workers move "up" the knowledge chain? 
- Will organizations flex hard enough to absorb these changes humanely? 
- Will we actually use AI to augment workers, instead of replacing them? 
- How *should* we rearrange work? 

Conclusion here.
