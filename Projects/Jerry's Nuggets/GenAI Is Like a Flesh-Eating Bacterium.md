# GenAI Is Like a Flesh-Eating Bacterium
(draft) 
*How this wave of innovation isn't like the others.* 

Before diving in, a declaration: I love what Generative AI is capable of doing, and am optimistic we can figure out how to use it intelligently. 

Huge wave of innovation with Generative AI has led to many conjectures about how it will affect employment. 

Opinions range from GenAI [just being a "normal" technology](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology) (so don't worry!), to it heralding the advent of [Fully Automated Luxury Communism](https://www.amazon.com/Fully-Automated-Luxury-Communism-Bastani-ebook/dp/B075WCGJDW/jerrymichalskisr) (less likely than pigs flying), to it catalyzing a general economic meltdown. 

It's this last extreme possibility that has me worried, for a few reasons. The reason I'll cover here is that the GenAI revolution isn't like previous revolutions. 

## There are always new jobs! 

In the 90s, I got a cold call from a researcher who was investigating the future of paper. When we talked, [Adina Levin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adina-levin-b771/), who became a good friend, proceeded to ask me great questions, which I tried to answer to the best my perspective allowed. When I thought she was done with questions, she'd ask another good one. 

Our conversation made me notice that the "paperless society" was a bit of a mirage on the horizon: every time we'd wipe out one use of paper (send a paper check recently?), another would pop up. If you look at the Amazonification of shopping, you'll wish you'd invested in cardboard. 

Conventional wisdom is that every prior wave of automation or innovation wiped out some jobs, but created new ones. Cars obsoleted blacksmiths (and many others), but brought gas stations, auto repair shops and more. Airlines wiped out rail and ship travel (well, in the US), but took us farther, faster than ever, while employing quite a few people. 

[[GenAI Automates Tasks, Not Jobs]] (so far)

GenAI Is Eating Entry-Level Jobs
