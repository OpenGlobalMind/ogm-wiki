# Aren't Books Dead?

Books are great things: containers of knowledge, durable artifacts of culture, annotatable inspirations, and more. 

But books are inert. They don't make it easy to put the knowledge they contain to work. They aren't updated often. In digital form, we overprotect their contents with Digital Rights Management software. 

Think of books as snapshots in time, as souvenirs of a particular arrangement of ideas and words from a particular author. 

We have an opportunity to [[Level Up Media]]. 

What if those book-souvenirs were doorways to something more alive, useful and connected? We call these new things [[Whatâ€™s a NeoBook|NeoBooks]].
