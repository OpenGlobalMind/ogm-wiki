# Trump Through the Trust Lens

Let's start with an assertion that may sound weird to anyone leaning Left: Many people trust Trump. 

Yup, I'm [perfectly aware](https://bra.in/9qaY2m) that Trump pegs the lies-per-minute meter, that he can't be trusted to honor a [contract](https://bra.in/3jk3Ew) or election, and that he uses lies strategically. I'll get to those. 

Understanding why Trump's followers trust him is important, especially if you believe his constant lying disqualifies him from being trustworthy. [Misunderestimating](https://bra.in/6j8bXb) Donald Trump is very dangerous. It's a big reason why he still has the power he has. 

Dr. Evil

If you're very Conservative (not even all the way MAGA), Trump has paid off better than any Conservative president since Reagan, who definitely changed the course of the country. Consider:
- Roe v Wade is gone. 
- In its wake, many states triggered draconian abortion laws. 
- A "fetal personhood" movement is rolling. 
- The Supreme Court now tilts hard Right (with McConnell's devious leadership). 
- The Federal bench has been larded with deep Conservatives (also McConnell). 

Trump has successfully undermined: 
- The Left, which is consistently wrong-footed (until This Kamala Moment). 
- Mainstream media (enemy of the people??). 
- Elections. 
- Science. 
- Social justice, from wokeness to DEI. 
- Our trust in one another. 
- Countless norms and institutions. 

He's having a side conversation. 

He understands how to use old and new media to own the space. Arguably, he understands modern power better than almost anyone. 

Trump has normalized execrable speech. 
## Trump has weaponized trust 


As a result, Trump has more elbow room than most anyone.
