# Leaf-Cutter Ants Can't Digest Leaves

[Leaf-cutter ants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leafcutter_ant) are also know as farmer ants, because they farm a fungus. That fungus metabolizes leaf matter, which the ants collect from the forest, mulch up with some ant spit, and feed to the fungus. In return, the fungus creates [Gongylidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongylidia) and oozes nectar, all of which feeds the ant colony. 

Happy fungus, happy hive. It's one of nature's beautiful [symbiotic relationships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis). 

Similarly, many humans are trying to make sense of the world by taking notes, enhancing those notes, and exploring shared notetaking. tktk

As background:

Here's an informative introduction to the symbiotic relationship some ants have with some fungi:

Finally, here's another documentary on the subject, [Planet Ant: Life Inside the Colony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n0SkIGARuo), plus this nexus [in Jerry's Brain](https://bra.in/6jY3b2). 

This all to explain our fondness for the metaphor of [[The Big Fungus]].
