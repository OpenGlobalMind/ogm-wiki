[DARVO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO) is the worst-named, most important concept in the domain of relationships in the last couple decades. It stands for **D**eny the abuse, then **A**ttack the victim for attempting to make them accountable for their offense, thereby **R**eversing **V**ictim and **O**ffender. 

Doesn't roll off the tongue, does it? It also doesn't store easily in long-term memory.
