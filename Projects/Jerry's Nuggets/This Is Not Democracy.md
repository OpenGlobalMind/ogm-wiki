# This Is Not Democracy

*We're just consumers now, not citizens.* 

We are three days from the 2024 US election, which seems as consequential an election as any I have lived through. And it's a mess. 

After two and a half years of campaigning, primaries and endless fundraising (almost $16B spent?), the pollsters tell us it's a coin toss: either side could win the Electoral College. We have a convicted felon threatening autocracy vs. a prosecutor offering hope, and it's a coin toss. 

Try as I might to unsubscribe from political donation requests, my email inbox has been irritatingly full of them for way too long. I bet yours has, too. 

For a reality check, do you know how many days passed from the day when Rishi Sunak called a [snap election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election) in the UK to the day he had to move out of 10 Downing Street? 

Forty-four days. 

That is all. Not quite a month and a half had passed, and Keir Starmer was moving in to the Prime Minister's quarters. This from our stodgy ancestors across the pond? 

There's something extremely broken about America's electoral system. It's actually many things, from the flawed Electoral College to its winner-take-all-delegates results, intense gerrymandering, and [Citizens United](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission), in which SCOTUS declared that money equals free speech and took the caps off election funding. 

That last one, about money, seems particularly important. 

Why are our elected officials begging for large sums of money constantly? Why do they have to devote a significant portion of their time between elections fundraising? Do we really think large sums of money come without strings attached? In the US, money talks, and it has drowned out our democracy. 

Democracy shouldn't be a money-focused exercise every four years. It should be ongoing 

This exercise we go through every four years bears as much resemblance to a desirable democratic process as a 

A hypothesis: it doesn't matter what the two major parties are saying or who represents them. If you pour enormous amounts of money into both sides of the conflict, the votes will end up quite evenly split. 

We are no longer citizens, but mere consumers. Our role is to pay through donations and votes, not to get involved in actual governance, tktktk.
