# This Is Not Democracy

We are five days from the 2024 US election, which seems as consequential an election as any I have lived through. And it's a mess. 

After two and a half years of campaigning, primaries and endless fundraising, the pollsters tell us it's a coin toss: either side could win the Electoral College. 

For a reality check, do you know how many days passed from the day when Rishi Sunak called a [snap election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election) in the UK to the day he had to move out of 10 Downing Street? 

Fourty-four days. 

That's all. Not quite a month and a half had passed, and Keir Starmer was moving in to the Prime Minister's quarters. This from our stodgy ancestors across the pond? 

There's something extremely broken about America's electoral system. It's actually many things, from the flawed Electoral College to its winner-take-all-delegates results, intense gerrymandering, and Citizens United, which found that money equals free speech and took the caps off election funding. 

That last one, about money, seems particularly important. 

Why are our elected officials begging for large sums of money constantly? Why do they have to devote a significant portion of their time between elections fundraising? Do we really think large sums of money come without strings attached? In the US, money talks, and it has drowned out our democracy. 

This exercise we go through every four years bears as much resemblance to a desirable democratic process as a 

A hypothesis: it doesn't matter what the two major parties are saying or who represents them. If you pour enormous amounts of money into both sides of the conflict, the votes will end up quite evenly split.
