# The Matsutake's Peculiar Ecosystem

(unfinished draft)

In her meditative book [The Mushroom at the End of the World](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WAM15DC/jerrymichalskisr): On the Possibility of Life in Capitalist Ruins (2015), anthropologist Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing describes how damage to existing ecosystems and human systems sometimes leads to new assemblages formed through adaptations. 

That's a mouthful, so let's unpack it with the main story Tsing tells, which involves the [matsutake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsutake) mushroom, a delicacy in Japan. 

Matsutake are foraged. Japan was exhausting its natural sources of matsutake as demand was rising in the 1980s. Then an unexpected confluence happened: some rural Southeast Asians, displaced by the Vietnam War and adjacent conflicts, found themselves in the US Pacific Northwest. 

Lessons about resilience, adaptability and innovation. 

This [[Fabulous Fungal Metaphors|fungal metaphor]] helps explain our fondness for the metaphor of [[The Big Fungus]].
