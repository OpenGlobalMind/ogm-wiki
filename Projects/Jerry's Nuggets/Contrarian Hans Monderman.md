# Contrarian: Hans Monderman
 
*Making things look riskier can make them safer?* 

You'll find context for this post, which is part of a short series, [[Introducing My Contrarians|here]]. 

In 2006, I met [Hans Monderman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Monderman) on a foggy day in the Dutch town of [Drachten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drachten), which he had helped improve. There, he gave me walking and driving tours of the town, while explaining the [Traffic Calming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_calming) process he had convinced them to implement. You can watch the ten short videos I posted to YouTube after my visit [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo3KWHqmDhA&list=PLreQNsM8LqWDEpdHm2v4MRk0qCa49Rhyf). 

There are so many useful lessons in Hans's story. I just get to give them a quick impressionist sketch in this 4-minute clip. Look for: 

- Some safety techniques don't actually make things safer. 
- We often try to remove risks, but making risks more palpable can work better. 
- When weighing counterintuitive decisions, leaving time for minds to shift matters. Deep change takes time. 
- Treating people on streets as citizens, not merely drivers and pedestrians, raises trust. 
- Design from Trust requires thoughtful design. 
- It can also rebuild community.

Next up: Contrarian Elinor Ostrom. 

As you'll see in this short series, Contrarians are masters of [[Rethink Constraints|rethinking constraints]]. They are also the foundations of [[Design from Trust]].
