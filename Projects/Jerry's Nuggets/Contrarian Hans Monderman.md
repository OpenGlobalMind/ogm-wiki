# Contrarian: Hans Monderman
(draft) 
*Making things riskier makes them safer?* 

You'll find context for this post, which is part of a short series, [[Introducing My Contrarians|here]]. 

In 2006, I met [Hans Monderman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Monderman) in the Dutch town of [Drachten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drachten), which he had helped improve. There, he gave me walking and driving tours of the town, while explaining the [Traffic Calming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_calming) process he had convinced them to implement. You can watch the ten short videos I posted to YouTube after my visit [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo3KWHqmDhA&list=PLreQNsM8LqWDEpdHm2v4MRk0qCa49Rhyf). 





Next up: [[Contrarian Elinor Ostrom]]. 

As you'll see in this short series, Contrarians are masters of [[Rethink Constraints|rethinking constraints]]. They are also the foundations of [[Design from Trust]]. 

If you read this far, a treat: In [my online Brain](https://www.jerrysbrain.com/), you'll find all my Contrarians [here](https://bra.in/4jrdQp), where you can see them in their greater context.
