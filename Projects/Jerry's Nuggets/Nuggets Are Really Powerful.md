# Nuggets Are Really Powerful

Back to Nuggets, which are really powerful: 

- Nuggets live in the open. They are open content.  
- These Nuggets live on Github (for now), which gives us several features:  
	- Every change is tracked and available through Github's version-control features.  
	- We can improve each Nugget over time, as a social document, via Github's [[Fork and Pull]] method.  
- Because they are hypertexts, Nuggets can be woven into their context with links and more.  
- Those links can include:  
	- Further reading  
	- Broader context  
	- Parallel versions of the same Nugget  
		- in different languages  
		- in different levels of difficulty  
		- in different modes or media  
		- published in mainstream media  
	- Source data, with analytic tools  
	- Resources to take action  
	- In-place chat or comments  
	- Communities and conversations you can join now  
	- Metadata!  
	- Software that instantiates what the Nuggets say  
		- (compare to how GPTs might do this; add page about GPTs; Emily Bender tweet)
	- Other NeoBooks this Nugget is in (or narratives, etc)  
	- Prompts for GPT  
- As social documents, nuggets contribute to [[Collective Intelligence]].  
- Nuggets are [composable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability) They are reusable in other narratives or NeoBooks.
