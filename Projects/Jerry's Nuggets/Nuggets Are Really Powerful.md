# Nuggets Are Really Powerful

Back to Nuggets, which are really powerful: 

- Nuggets live in the open. They are open content.  
- These Nuggets live on Github (for now), which gives us several capabilities:  
	- Every change is tracked and available through Github's version-control features.  
	- We can improve each Nugget over time, as a social document, via Github's [[Fork and Pull]] method.  
- Because they are hypertexts, Nuggets can be woven into their context with links and more.  
- Those links can include:  
	- Metadata!  
	- Broader context  
		- Further reading  
		- Relevant Thoughts in Jerry's Brain  
	- Parallel versions of the same Nugget  
		- in different languages  
		- in different levels of difficulty  
		- with more (or less) explanation or examples  
		- in different modes or media  
			- as a slide in a presentation
			- as a segment of video  
			- as a graphic novel or animation  
		- published in mainstream media  
		- mentions in other media  
		- in other NeoBooks  
	- Conversations  
		- In-place chat or comments  
		- Communities and conversations you can join now  
	- Get more involved  
		- Improve this Nugget: offer edits  
		- Use this Nugget in your own NeoBook  
		- Fork this Nugget and make it your own  
		- Source data, with analytic tools  
		- Resources to take action  
	- Software that instantiates what the Nuggets say  
		- (compare to how GPTs might do this; add page about GPTs; Emily Bender tweet)
	- Chatbots that let you talk to this and other Nuggets  
	- Prompts for GPT  
- As social documents, nuggets contribute to [[Collective Intelligence]].  
- Nuggets are [composable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability) They are reusable in other narratives or NeoBooks.  
- A wish: A memorable trope (like Cut, Copy Paste, Undo) that helps us orient ourselves to all these possibilities.
