# Behind the Reel: Neural Nets in 1988

I recently debuted [my speaker's reel](https://vimeo.com/1006299404?share=copy), four minutes of thumpa-thumpa "hire me!" that actually does a great job of explaining what I do, while keeping the energy high. This reel contains many short moments that are really significant to me, so I thought I'd elaborate on those moments in a quick series of posts. 

At [0:58 in the reel](https://vimeo.com/1006299404?share=copy#t=58.297) you'll see this image, which is the cover of a report I wrote in 1988, when I was the neural networks analyst for New Science Associates, a small spinout from the 600-lb. gorilla in the tech-analyst space, [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en).  (Gartner bought New Science, which was founded by Gartner alumni, right about the time I left the firm in 1992.)

You can download the full report [here](https://bra.in/6qa8XE), where I've woven it into its context in my Brain. 

There are two other moments in the reel that show the research my colleagues and I churned out, here:

The section with the green banner in the second photo is the tables of contents from each biweekly issue, stacked together so you could find the article you needed. 

We did offer our research in Lotus Notes, but the Web was just a twinkle in Tim Berners-Lee's eyes at that point, not the public utility we rely on today. 

In the early days when we had one, then two research services (which turned into seven by the time I left in 1992), we would have a "stuffing party" when the issue returned from the printer. We'd get in out conference room and stuff the new issue into labeled 9x12 envelopes, commenting on the clients whose names we recognized. It was a very physical way of getting familiar with the client base. 

Because our retainer research services offered answers to client inquiries, some of the names would trigger comments like, "damn, I owe her two inquiries!"
## On finding your calling

My time at New Science was special in many ways, but the first big one was the moment I realized that: 1) I was a capable translator between the geeks and the business folk who needed what the geeks were building, 2) my instincts on what was up were pretty accurate, and 3) I could write that all down in ways that made sense. 

All my prior jobs had been placeholders, ways to earn a living while figuring out what I was meant to do. This one clicked in place. 

In retrospect, I was fortunate to land in a startup where I had a smart editor/boss in [Ken Sonenclar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kensonenclar/), and a joyful, intelligent, collaborative band of colleagues who were as curious about the intersection of tech and business as I was. 
## On the amazing evolution of neural nets 

My 1988 report was during the second lifetime of neural nets. Their first lifetime started
