# Trump and Constraints

Trump and Constraints:
- Shattering constraints, like the Overton Window
- Leveraging constraints, like mainstream media's inability to turn off cameras
- Trump as the least constrained politician in ages 
- Nobody (and no law) has been able to constrain Trump
- Trump may have fashioned his own constraints 


This is a companion piece to [[Trump Through the Trust Lens]], as well as [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLreQNsM8LqWAJFWfH3UCRo3QLxV8-wtol) about Trump and his strategies, which I posted in 2020.
