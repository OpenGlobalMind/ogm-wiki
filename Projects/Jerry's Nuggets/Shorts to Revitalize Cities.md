# Shorts to Revitalize Cities 
 (draft) 

 [[Revitalizing Cities]] is part of [[Storytelling of What Works]], which is based on the idea that [[Storytelling + Relationships + Resources = Lasting Change]].

This Shorts playlist is here; the individual videos (with added resources) are:

- [[Build an Edible Landscape]]! 
- [[Pretend it Exists]]! 
- [[Curitiba's Rebirth]] 
- [[Get Locals Talking]]! 
- [[Use Pattern Languages]]! 
- [[Pedestrians Over Cars]]! 

Each Short is woven into its context in [[Jerry's Brain]], [here](https://bra.in/9qaErm).
