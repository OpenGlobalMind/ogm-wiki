## Jerry's Brain + Rel8

Jerry's Brain is particularly interesting in the context of Rel8 because: 

- it offers a close-up view of one person curating a shared memory for a quarter century, 
- it is a starting point for collaborations to create those shared memories, and 
- it is a use case that can help us find our way to generalized insights.
