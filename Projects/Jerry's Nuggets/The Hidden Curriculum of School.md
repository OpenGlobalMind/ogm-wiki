# The Hidden Curriculum of School
(draft) 
*What school really teaches us.* 

You know how sometimes the thing that says it's doing one thing is really doing another? That's what a hidden curriculum is. It's the lessons that a system is actually teaching you, even while it claims to be doing something entirely different. It's the unspoken design of the system, the important stuff we don't say out loud. 

I'm focused here on the hidden curriculum of school, but the hidden curriculum can apply to many other things. For example, in [In Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life](https://www.amazon.com/Over-Our-Heads-Mental-Demands/dp/0674445880/jerrymichalskisr) (1994), Robert Kegan wrote about the hidden curriculum of everyday life. 

Educator Philip Jackson coined the term [Hidden Curriculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_curriculum) in [this 1968 essay](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Classrooms-Philip-W-Jackson/dp/0807730343/jerrymichalskisr). My first exposure to the term was in [John Taylor Gatto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taylor_Gatto)'s work, which started for me with his essay [The Six-Lesson Schoolteacher](https://www.cantrip.org/gatto.html), which [Doc Searls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls) sent me long ago, in an issue of [The Sun](https://www.thesunmagazine.org/). 

Gatto writes from the heart and minces no words. 

To explore the broader context, here's how I've curated it in my outboard Brain (or open it in a new tab [here](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/e7a14731-712d-e428-557d-bb599972755b)):
