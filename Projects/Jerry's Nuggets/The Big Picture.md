# The Big Picture

This is [[Jerry Michalski|Jerry's]] project space, seen from above. 

Important questions (see [map](https://bra.in/4j4mGv)):

- How did we lose faith in humans?
- How can we build it back?
- Why don't we know what we know?
- How might we make better collaborative decisions? 

Pragmatic goals:

- [[Level up Media|Leveling up Media]]  
	- Prototyping Shared Memory  
	- Publishing [[NeoBooks Introduction|NeoBooks]] to attract people to their better online versions
- Pioneering [[Design from Trust]]
- Seeding [[The Big Fungus]]

Higher-level (societal) goals:

- Reduce global conflicts
- Help humans make better decisions together
	- Liberate ideas, then instrument them  
	- Facilitate comparison of points of view and sharing of experiments  
- Help humans design better systems and institutions 
- Rebuild trust
- Rebuild community
- Use technology to augment humans, not replace them
