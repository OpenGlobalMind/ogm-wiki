# Wikipedia Started as the Nupedia
 
*Thoughts on redesign from trust.*

[Design from Trust](https://www.designfromtrust.com/) isn't a tweak of existing systems, it's a rethink. Systems that are designed from trust are different enough from the systems they replace to be surprising, sometimes to the point of defying conventional logic and making people squirm. Wikipedia makes a great, familiar example. 

Wikipedia wasn't always a Wiki. It started life innocently enough in 2000 as the Nupedia, the brainchild of Jimmy Wales, who wanted to create a free online encyclopedia for the world's benefit. 

Jimmy hired Larry Sanger and the two went about the very ambitious project of writing an encyclopedia the way a publisher might: they recruited volunteer editors and assigned them to their domains of expertise (think German, geography, biology, tech, economics, art...). Then they instituted a seven-step editorial process to ensure each article's quality. 

Progress was slow. After some 18 months, they had published fewer than 20 articles. Production of a whole encyclopedia seemed out of reach. 

As the Nupedia crew struggled to birth reliable articles, Wales and Sanger learned about Wikis, which the programmer Ward Cunningham had invented in 1994, so that he and his colleagues would have a quick, HyperCard-inspired way to build websites rich with internal links. (A pioneer of [Pattern Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language) in software, Ward's first substantial Wiki was the [Portland Pattern Repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Pattern_Repository).) 

Wikis are pretty simple. They save every version of every page created, which makes correcting mistakes (or vandalism) straightforward: just revert to the previous saved page. Wikis also allow participants to track changes on pages they care about, so they can see (and possibly revert) changes that matter to them. Contrast this with the CMSes (Content Management Systems) that most publications use, which hard-code their editorial stages as workflow, and allow only authorized personnel to touch pages in production. 

Making links between pages in a Wiki is super simple; linking to things on the Web is easy, too. There's no formal editorial process (on Wikipedia, over time, norms emerged, then got codified). There are no titles (like Editor in Chief) or turfs, which encourages open participation. Notably, you don't have to be qualified to post on a topic to do so. Anyone can. Counterintuitively, that turns out to work very well. 

Wales told his editors they had set up one such Wiki and named it Wikipedia, not expecting much. From that point on, the Wikipedia story became notable online history. Since its launch in 2001, Wikipedia has stayed in or near the top ten most-visited Websites on the planet — and the only one of those that doesn't invade your privacy with cookies and ads. 

A question I ask audiences all the time is, "Who has used Wikipedia in the last few months?" Predictably, most of the hands in the room go up. Then I ask the question I'm really after: "Who remembers the moment they figured out how Wikipedia works?" That often elicits chuckles and gasps of recognition, as people flash back to the seemingly out-of-control process I just described. 

The Wiki way is not a tweak of the usual editorial process. In many ways, it's the opposite. Instead of one person assigned to write a piece and another to edit it, then maybe another to approve it, *anyone* can start or edit any page. Incomplete pages are just as visible as finished ones. And the pages are never quite "done," since they are subject to edits forever. 

This openness and sharing of trust creates a sense of shared responsibility that is quite addictive. 

This one example of the Wikipedia generalizes to dynamics that apply broadly to projects that are designed from trust in a wide range of domains.

Three sobering side notes: 
- When I started using Wikis, I fully expected we would all be collaborating with them now. Alas, Wikipedia "ate" the Wiki space, and we're still sharing separate documents. 
- The recent rise of GenAI chatbots that like to give full answers instead of offering links to where the answers live will likely contribute to continued drops in traffic for Wikipedia. Ironically, the Wikipedia corpus has long been an important training element for GenAI. 
- Wikipedia's history is not all bright and shiny; you can explore its dark side [here](https://bra.in/8v2YLe).
