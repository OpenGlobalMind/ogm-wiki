# The Future isn't AI. It’s CHI.
(draft) 
*Collective Hybrid Intelligence.* 

We are all feeling the ground shift.

Generative AI is dissolving the "soft tissue" of our daily work — the emails, the summaries, the reports, the basic code — at breathtaking speed.

For many, this creates a quiet terror. I call it the **[Sword of Damocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles#Sword_of_Damocles) Effect**: *If the software does 80% of my tasks, will my employer keep me for the remaining 20%? When will the sword drop on me?* 

That fear is the single biggest blocker to innovation and transformation today. It freezes us.

But what if we flipped the script?

## I’ve been a "Cyborg" for 28 years

Long before ChatGPT, I began melding my mind with software called **[TheBrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheBrain)**. I didn't use it to replace my thinking; I used it to *[extend](https://www.jerrysbrain.com/)* it. TheBrain's latest update infuses GenAI into the software; I'm now working at the frontier of human curation and machine intelligence. 

When you truly partner with software — when you move from "user" to "Cyborg" — you don't get replaced. You get what they discovered in **[Advanced Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_chess)**: A human+machine team that outperforms any AI (or human) alone.

## From AI to CHI

The goal shouldn't be Artificial Intelligence. It should be **CHI: Collective Hybrid Intelligence.** Let's blend human intelligence well with these new, alien intelligences of our own creation. 

As an Aikido practitioner, I love that "CHI" echoes **_Ki_**—the flow of energy.

- **AI** is a tool that crunches data, extending our capacities.
    
- **CHI** is a _flow_ of intelligence between humans and machines, orchestrated by trust.
    

## The Trust Key

You cannot build CHI in a culture of surveillance. You can't ask employees to meld with a system that holds a sword over their heads.

To win this future, we have to move from **Design from Mistrust** (monitoring inputs) to **[Design from Trust](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/design-from-trust-how-build-better-futures-jerry-michalski-lxv4f/)** (unleashing outcomes).

I’ve developed a new talk on how to make this shift. How to stop fearing the "task dissolution" and start building a Collective Intelligence that is wiser, faster, and more human than anything we’ve seen before.

Are you ready to build the Cyborg future?
