# Reality Check
(draft) 
*Surely he's not serious!*

Some of you, dear readers, may be thinking, "What planet is Jerry from? Design from Trust? Srsly? Doesn't he see the messes we're in? [[The Polycrisis]]? The Metacrisis? Doesn't he see how broken trust is?" I don't blame you if those thoughts showed up right away. 

Not only have institutions of various kinds been losing our trust on their own (think Boeing's 737 Max mess, )

Building a strategy around trust in such low-trust times must seem like a fool's errand. 

Or is it? 

This is [[Not Naïve Trust]]
