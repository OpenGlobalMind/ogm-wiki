# Reality Check

Some of you, dear readers, are likely thinking, "What planet is Jerry from? Design from Trust? Doesn't he see the mess we're in? Doesn't he see how broken trust is?" I don't blame you. 

Not only have institutions of various kinds been losing our trust on their own (think Boeing's 737 Max mess, )

Building a strategy around trust in such low-trust times must seem like a fool's errand. 

Or is it?
