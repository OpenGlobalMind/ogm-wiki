Design from Trust? Srsly? 

Some of you, dear readers, may be thinking, "What planet is Jerry from? Doesn't he see the messes we're in? [[The Polycrisis]]? The [Metacrisis](https://bra.in/2joEQY)? Doesn't he see how broken trust is?" I don't blame you if those thoughts showed up right away. After all, people's first reactions when they encounter systems that are designed from trust are [[The 2 Oh Shit!s]]. 

Here's a quick list of reasons your skepticism is warranted: 

Not only have institutions of various kinds been losing our trust on their own (think Boeing's 737 Max mess, )

Building a strategy around trust in such low-trust times must seem like a fool's errand. 

Or is it? 

This is [[Not Naïve Trust]]
