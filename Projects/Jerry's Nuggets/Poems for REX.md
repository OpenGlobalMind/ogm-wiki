# Poems for REX 
(draft) 
*Bring poems to your meetings!* 

In 2010 I launched REX, the Relationship Economy eXpedition, a thing in retrospect I would call a mastermind group, though at the time I called it a think-and-do tank. 

I started a habit of reading a poem at the start of every REX session or call, a habit that got me reading far more poetry than I had before. I loved it, and I think REX's members did, too. 

REX is now just a monthly alumni Zoom call, but my habit of reading more poems and selecting those that would be REX-worthy continues, so I've kept the name of the Thought in my Brain where these poems are all collected as "[Poems for REX](https://bra.in/8pWnAo)." (Don't miss "[Poems Read in REX](https://bra.in/9pxPKp)" to its left.)
