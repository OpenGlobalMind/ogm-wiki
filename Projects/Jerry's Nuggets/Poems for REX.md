In 2010 I launched REX, the Relationship Economy eXpedition, an offer that these days I would call a mastermind group, though at the time I called it a think-and-do tank. 

I started a habit of reading a poem at the start of every REX session or call, a habit that got me reading far more poetry than I had before. I loved it, and I think REX's members did, too. 

REX is now just a monthly alumni Zoom call, but my habit of reading more poems and selecting those that would be REX-worthy continues, so I've kept the name of the Thought in [my Brain](https://www.jerrysbrain.com/) where I've collected all these poems as "[Poems for REX](https://bra.in/8pWnAo)." (Don't miss "[Poems Read in REX](https://bra.in/9pxPKp)" to its left, or my [Poetry Canon](https://bra.in/5qzNR6).) 

A simple way to bring more poems into your life is to sign up for the Poetry Foundation's [Poem of the Day](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/poem-of-the-day) emails. There are others, and also apps that will supply you with poems. 

My poem guru these days is [Ken Homer](https://bra.in/6qaymq), who has a preternatural ability to find (or write!) poems that fit every conversation. It's become a ritual for OGM calls ([Open Global Mind](https://openglobalmind.com/)) that we hear Ken recite a poem at the end of the calls.
