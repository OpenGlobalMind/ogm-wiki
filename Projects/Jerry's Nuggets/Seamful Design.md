# Seamful Design

A common wish with software is "seamless" design, meaning there are not awkward bumps or gaps in the user's experience. 

With [[Multiplayer Sensemaking]], seamlessness may be the wrong goal. Instead, how about creating "seamful" experiences, where the boundaries between collaborating tools are thoughtfully designed and important to the user's experience? 

Seamful design traces its way back to Mark Weiser's work on Ubiquitous Computing, and is described in [this 2003 paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1515032).
