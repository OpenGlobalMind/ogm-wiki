# On Sensemaking
(draft) 
*That elusive thing.* 

One of humans' biggest quests has been to understand the world around us. To be frank, we're not all that good at it yet. 
## Visions and inspirations 
Sensemaking has many cousins, including: 

- [Collective Intelligence](https://bra.in/9q5WVv) 
- [Collaborative Sensemaking](https://bra.in/5pKkrp) 
- [Hive Mind](https://bra.in/3jY98A) or Group Mind 
- [Extended Mind](https://bra.in/8vADRa) 
- [Large Scale Collective IQ](https://bra.in/5px926) 
- [Knowledge Ecosystems](https://bra.in/8jYWD2) 
- [Superintelligence](https://bra.in/7j8bKk) (which might or might not involve humans) 

Opposites: 

- [Herd Mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_mentality) 
- [Crowd (Mob) Psychology](https://bra.in/8jrE65) 

Of course, sensemaking shows up in fiction: 

- The [Encyclopedia Galactica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_Galactica) in Asimov's Foundation series 
- A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer, in Neal Stephenson's [The Diamond Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age) 
- Hitchhiker's Guide?? 

And in speculative (wishful?) non-fiction: 

- 1500-500 BC: [Indra's Net](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra's_net) 
- 1937: HG Wells' article [World Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Brain) 
- 1945: Vannevar Bush's [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) 
- 1945: Teilhard De Chardin and Vladimir Vernadsky's idea of [[The Noosphere]] 
- 1960: JCR Licklider's [Man-Computer Symbiosis](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html) 
- 1968: Doug Engelbart's [Mother of All Demos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos) 
- 1974: Ted Nelson's [Computer Lib/Dream Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines) 
- 1977: Adele Goldberg and Alan Kay's [Personal Dynamic Media](https://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Kay1977.pdf) 
- 1980: Deleuze and Guattari's [Rhizomal Networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_(philosophy)) 
- 1987: Apple's [Knowledge Navigator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umJsITGzXd0) video 

You can browse all of these, in context, in my Brain [here](https://bra.in/2pxbo6). To suggest others, please [write me](mailto:sociate@gmail.com). 

From the tech side, many different efforts include: 

- Dynamic Knowledge Repositories ([DKRs](https://bra.in/6jg32r)) 
- Distributed Knowledge Graphs ([DKGs](https://bra.in/6vP3G9)) 
- Enterprise Knowledge Graphs ([EKGs](https://bra.in/7pK43B)) 
- Personal Knowledge Graphs ([PKGs](https://bra.in/4pR8Wy)) 
- Personal Knowledge Networks ([PKNs](https://bra.in/2vmaeJ)) 
- Open Knowledge Networks ([OKNs](https://bra.in/7qw9GD)) 

In my imagination: [[The Big Fungus]]. 

## A caveat 

Despite (obviously) being a huge fan of sensemaking, I'm also a realist. That means I think many actions we take aren't based on logic, reasoning, and measured debate about actual potential outcomes, but instead are a maelstrom of fear, spin, factoids, misrepresentations, etc. 

One of our greatest fears is being shunned by our neighbors, our communities. That's why I have [this Thought](https://bra.in/2vPB9q) in my Brain.
