# Spatial Computing Isn't a Desirable Future

With great fanfare, Apple recently unveiled their Apple vision pro, which is now available for general use. First, a major tip of the hat to Apple's engineers for solving hundreds, maybe thousands of thorny technical issues in creating this device. They went all out, and did really well. Many things are done really elegantly.

Unfortunately, some of their solutions create awkward moments for users. For example, if someone sits next to you wearing the goggles, they think they see your eyes, but they're really looking at an external display that is simulating what your eyes look like at that moment. The goggles are completely solid and full of electronics. But they wanted the perception of seeing the person's eyes. It doesn't really work.

Like Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse vision, Spatial Computing is an isolated, insular world. We might see other people's avatars, but we're walking around in the real world with something strapped over our face that separates us from reality. 



Alas, neither [[the Metaverse]] nor Apple's Spatial Computing vision, nor any combination of those two that I can imagine, describes a world that sounds beneficial for humans.
