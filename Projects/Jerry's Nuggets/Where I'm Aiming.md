# Where I'm Aiming 
(draft)
This page builds on [the /now page](https://www.jerrymichalski.com/now) that my sig file points to, in order to help interested folks catch up with my thinking and see where I'm headed. 

The two talks I gave at the Bucharest Unfinished conference do a nice job of explaining my thesis, origins and hopes (a bit) around trust. [The first one](https://youtu.be/gf3vp0Wquz8) was virtual, [the second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N47GRiYZ0p8) in person. You can see both of them in their full context [in my Brain](https://bra.in/3qnVD9). Also useful: [[My Story of Trust]] (22 mins). 

I just launched a Substack titled [Rethinking Constraints](https://rethinkconstraints.substack.com/), where I plan to pour most of my posts (per [[On Crossposting|this post]] about crossposting). All subscriptions welcome; no need to pay. I don't like paywalled content, and I'm still wrestling with what a paid benefit for that Substack would be. But of course, I'd love the support. 

Every week I host four OGM-related Zoom calls (ok, one is in Jitsi). You can see what they are and how to join them [here](https://openglobalmind.com/ogm_calendar), or watch all of them [here](https://bra.in/6jobWY). The 8am PT Thursday calls are a great place to start. They are the kernel of the OGM community. 

Keynote speeches and consulting are my main revenue sources. To that end, I just created a new speaker demo reel, which you'll find on my [newly refreshed personal site](https://www.jerrymichalski.com/). All recommendations and referrals very welcome. 

I prefer to work in public, which means several things. Almost all the calls I host are on YouTube for public view, alongside videos I create just because something is burning in my brain (the wet one). 

The best place to engage with my public writings right now is a little geeky: I use Obsidian to push Markdown files (for maximum interoperability) to Github (for version control and public sharing). This is part of [[Peter Kaminski]]'s plan for his [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/) project, which isn't quite a wiki yet, because when his static site builder shows those pages on the web, we don't have a good "edit this page" function yet, but anyone who knows Github can do so. 

In my OGM vault/wiki space, you'll find the finished posts, as well as many other files, some of which are titles only and skeletal text, but they'll give you a great idea of where I'm aiming. In particular, I would point you to [The Queue](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/projects/jerry's_nuggets/the_queue), which is the list of posts I plan to write (I explain my crossposting approach [here](https://bra.in/2pRVKx)) and the [Table of Contents](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/projects/jerry's_nuggets/dft_book_contents_(the_toc)) for a [NeoBook](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/projects/jerry's_nuggets/neobooks_introduction) I'm writing about [Design from Trust](https://bra.in/9jYPAq). So far, LinkedIn is the platform where my posts get the most engagement, a situation I expect to last a while. 

My [[Jerry's Brain|external Brain]] is the largest, handmade, publicly available mind map anyone I know has ever heard of. I curate it every day, an activity I love. We're still wrestling with how to connect it to GenAI, and how to make it more publicly useful, because TheBrain software is a bit scary to some folks. Everything I've described on this page is in my Brain, and much, much more. 

I'm open to all [suggestions](mailto:sociate@gmail.com) for improving this page (and my whole set of projects), especially from anyone who has found their way to this page and read it this far. Thank you!
