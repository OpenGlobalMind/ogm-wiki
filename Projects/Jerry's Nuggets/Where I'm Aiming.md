# Where I'm Aiming 

The two talks I gave at the Bucharest Unfinished conference do a nice job of explaining my thesis, origins and hopes (a bit) around trust. [The first one](https://youtu.be/gf3vp0Wquz8) was virtual, [the second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N47GRiYZ0p8) in person. 

I'm working in public using Obsidian to push Markdown files (for maximum interoperability) to Github (for version control and public sharing). This is part of Pete Kaminski's plan for his [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/) project, which isn't quite a wiki yet, because when his static site builder shows those pages on the web, we don't have a good "edit this page" function yet, but anyone who knows Github can do so. 

In my OGM vault/wiki space, you'll find the finished posts, as well as many other files, some of which are titles only and skeletal text, but they'll give you a great idea of where I'm aiming. In particular, I would point you to [The Queue](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/projects/jerry's_nuggets/the_queue), which is the list of posts I plan to write (I explain my crossposting approach [here](https://bra.in/2pRVKx)) and the [Table of Contents](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/projects/jerry's_nuggets/dft_book_contents_(the_toc)) for a [NeoBook](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/projects/jerry's_nuggets/neobooks_introduction) I'm writing about [Design from Trust](https://bra.in/9jYPAq). 

Every week I host four OGM-related Zoom calls (one is in Jitsi). You can see what they are and how to join them (you'd be very welcome!) [here](https://openglobalmind.com/ogm_calendar). 

Finally, I just started [this Substack](https://rethinkconstraints.substack.com/), where I plan to pour most of my posts (per that crossposting post). All subscriptions welcome; no need to pay. I don't want to paywall my content, and I'm still wrestling with what a paid bonus would be. 

I'm not sure if that's descriptive enough, or after you familiarize yourself, what else I should add. Open to all suggestions.
