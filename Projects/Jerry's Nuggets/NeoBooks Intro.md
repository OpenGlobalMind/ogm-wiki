# NeoBooks Introduction

Thank you for buying this souvenir. 

That's what a book is now: a souvenir, a memento of a snapshot of a specific collection of ideas at a moment in time. You can get it autographed, you can mark it up, you can make it your own copy (though your ebook will never get that well-loved look of tattered pages and dinged covers). But the information in it is trapped and frozen.

We think of the ideas that compose this NeoBook as "nuggets" that we string together to create narratives. A collection of narratives becomes a [point of view](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmId2x6JSQE&feature=related). 

Nuggets are really powerful:
- Nuggets live in the open. They are open content. 
- They live on Github (for now), which gives us several features:
	- Every version and change stays available.
	- We can improve each one over time, as a social document.
- As hypertexts, nuggets can be woven into their context with links and more.
- Those links can include:
	- Further reading
	- Resources to take action
	- Communities and conversations you can join now
	- Metadata! 
- Nuggets are [composable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability) (reusable in other narratives)

To create an eBook, we roll these nuggets up in the order dictated by a Table of Contents, add front matter and back matter, then use software that exports documentation and books. 

But books are inert. 

Worse, the Digital Rights Management software that wraps most eBooks will make it hard for you to put their information to use effectively in the world. 

The more interesting artifact lives online, openly. It is alive, it is connected, and it is free. 

This NeoBook is an act of [[Level Up Media|leveling up media]], one of many we're experimenting with. 

Your act of buying this book supports our community. We are grateful.
