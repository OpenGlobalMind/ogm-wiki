# NeoBooks Introduction

Thank you for buying this souvenir. 

That's what a book is now: a souvenir, a memento of a snapshot of a specific collection of ideas at a moment in time. You can get it autographed, you can mark it up, you can make it your own copy (though your ebook will never get that well-loved look), but the information in it is trapped and frozen. 

The Digital Rights Management software that wraps most eBooks will make it hard for you to put its information to use effectively in the world. 

The more interesting artifact lives online, openly. It is alive, and it is free. 

This is an act of [[Level Up Media|leveling up media]]. One of many we're experimenting with. 

Your act of buying this book supports our community, and we are grateful.
