# NeoBooks Introduction

Thank you for buying this souvenir. 

That's what a book is now: a souvenir, a memento of a snapshot of a specific collection of ideas at a moment in time. You can get it autographed, you can mark it up, you can make it your own copy (though your ebook will never get that well-loved look of tattered pages and dinged covers). But the information in it is trapped and frozen.

We think of the ideas that compose this NeoBook as "nuggets" that we string together in playlists to create narratives. On top of that, a collection of narratives becomes a [point of view](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmId2x6JSQE&feature=related). 

Nuggets are really powerful:
- Nuggets live in the open. They are open content. 
- They live on Github (for now), which gives us several features:
	- Every version and change is tracked and available.
	- We can improve each Nugget over time, as a social document.
- As hypertexts, nuggets can be woven into their context with links and more.
- Those links can include:
	- Further reading
	- Resources to take action
	- Communities and conversations you can join now
	- Metadata! 
- Nuggets are [composable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability) (reusable in other narratives)

To create an eBook, we roll these nuggets up in the order dictated by a Table of Contents, add front matter and back matter, then use software that exports documentation and books. (Lots more on creating your own NeoBook [[Creating a NeoBook|here]].)

But books are inert. They are snapshots, frozen in time. They have no means for authors to learn from their readers or to invite readers into conversations. Or for readers to meet one another and form or join communities of interest. 

Worse, the Digital Rights Management software that wraps most eBooks will make it hard for you to put their information to use effectively in the world. 

The more interesting artifact lives online, openly. It is alive, it is connected, and it is free. 

Books are an entry vector, because they are recognizable cultural artifacts. Smart people put their knowledge inside books, right? 

But as we have just explained, the book aspect of a NeoBook is just a starting point, a familiar frame of reference. From there, things get really interesting. 

This NeoBook is an act of [[Level Up Media|leveling up media]], one of many we're experimenting with. 

Your act of buying this book supports our community. We are grateful.
