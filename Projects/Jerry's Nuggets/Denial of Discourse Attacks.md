# Denial of Discourse Attacks
(draft) 
*What do you do when some parties don't want discourse?* 

You've probably heard of [Denial of Service Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) on the Internet, or their angrier cousins who are harder to track and stop, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks. 

There are many tactics, most notably [Flood the Zone with Shit](https://bra.in/9jMBre), which is also known as the [Gish Gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop) and the [Firehose of Falsehood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firehose_of_falsehood). 

The Big Lie. This is what a Post-Truth world looks like.
