# How Might We Blend the Best of the Old and New?
 (draft) 
*It is not wrong to go back for that which you have forgotten.* 

This is the title for a new, limited-run podcast series on [Rethink the Future](https://rethinkconstraints.substack.com/podcast). It's also a major goal of mine. 

The Akan people of West Africa have a word, [Sankofa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankofa), which fits the quest I'll describe here. It means "to reach back," and is encapsulated in the African proverb "It is not wrong to go back for that which you have forgotten." Sankofa has followed the African Diaspora, and is an important element for connecting back to origins.
