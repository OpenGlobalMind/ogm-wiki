# The NeoBook Dashboard (Book-O-Matic?)
(draft)
*An app to help write books* 

[[NeoBooks are Mushrooms of The Big Fungus]]. 

More practically, NeoBooks are playlists of composable, reusable Nuggets. Writing a NeoBook means understanding [[Nuggetization]], then plotting a course through Nuggets you want to include. Your NeoBook's table of contents is the playlist you create. 

Composing books this way could use some visual support, which is the goal of this app. If you've ever used or seen the Scrivener app, you'll remember its corkboard view, where each chunk of your manuscript (think Nuggets) looks like an index card pinned to the corkboard. 

This is one of several [[ATproto Apps]] we would love to see exist.
