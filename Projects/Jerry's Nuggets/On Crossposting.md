# On Crossposting

You have valuable ideas. Where to post them? In what medium? Text, videos, animations, tweets? 

Some years back, in the Internet's [salad days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_days), the answers were more straightforward. Start a blog on Blogger or Movable Type, for example, or try LiveJournal or MySpace. Today, there's a mad variety of places to post, making it hard to choose from among them. 

Why choose just one? 

It's more complicated to maintain, but putting the same post in several places gets you the benefit of each platforms' special powers. If you like to be orderly about such things, the question arises: which of these copies do you think of as the "original," or the hub of the other copies? 

The brilliant participants in IndieWeb have thought about this, detailing various techniques, including: 

- [POSE](https://indieweb.org/POSE) (2007 Publish Once, Syndicate Everywhere) 
- [PESOS](https://indieweb.org/PESOS) (Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate (to your) Own Site) 
- [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) 
- [PESETAS](https://indieweb.org/PESETAS) (Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate Everything To A Silo) 

I think I'm a POSSE guy. ![[j3rry_spiff_A_surreal_digital_illustration_depicting_the_chaos__dab1a48a-13e9-4bbf-b9d6-4e739a2889f6.png]]
## How I'm crossposting

For me, the "Ur" copy of every post is on Pete's [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/), which means: 

- I write it in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (using [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown))
- Save (push) it to [Github](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) 
- Where [Massive Wiki Builder](https://massive.wiki/massive_wiki_builder) automagically regenerates its web pages, "publishing" the new one
- Copy the new page's URL and add it to the crossposts 
- Add that page to my Brain, too 

Functionally, that turns into the footer you'll see on this page, after the separating line. 

I don't want to make the crossposted articles confusing, so on those, I just link back here by adding "The Ur-post lives here."

## Useful details

This may seem evident, but in case it isn't: The tools I'm using and the places I put them are likely to change over time. 

Writing first to Github in Markdown so content is available widely. 

This crossposting process does entail considerable manual labor (though certainly no sweat, heavy lifting or callous building). 

I don't crosspost everything, everywhere. Today, everything will start in Massive Wiki, then go to Substack. So if you'd like the simpler way of seeing everything, subscribe to my Substack (more about what I'm doing there in different post, soon).

Mix of media. YouTube. Podcasts! 

There is definitely a risk that folks who do follow on multiple platforms see duplicate posts. I hope they will adapt, favoring their easiest way. If that becomes a big issue, I may need to rethink this approach. 

Lmk what you think! And what you do!
