# On Trump and Constraints
(draft) 
*He's been teaching a masterclass on shattering constraints.* 

Trump and Constraints:
- Shattering constraints, like the Overton Window
- Leveraging constraints, like mainstream media's inability to turn off cameras
- Trump as the least constrained politician in ages 
- Nobody (and no law) has been able to constrain Trump
- Trump may have fashioned his own constraints 



This is a companion piece to [[Trump Through the Trust Lens]]. It also pairs well with [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLreQNsM8LqWAJFWfH3UCRo3QLxV8-wtol) about Trump and his strategies, which I posted in 2020. 

This is part of a series on [[The Dark Side of Rethinking Constraints]].
