## Trust Unlocks Abundance 

[[Trust Unlocks Creativity (and Genius)]] 

[[GenAI Trust Issues]] 

[[Innovation We Don't Talk About]] 

Most people trust their peers as much as scientists! 
Decline of authority. 
Major scientific breakthroughs happening now. Soon could be very different. 
Infusion of tech into every corner. 
Approach it wrong and it blows up. 
Design from Trust is the fix. 
Not appreciating that is chaos on your watch. 
People who have shared culture will fracture if they're not read into this change. 

Flow some Edelman observations into my deck. 
2-day offsite for future planning w care. 
Smartest places to place our bets. 
Precursor w stakeholder interviews and online surveys. How attuned are these fears? 

His new client = Convergent: security systems integration. 
Culture keeps coming up in interviews as their primary differentiator. But it's a shared belief system that D1 athletes would have. Committed to teamwork to a person. Very particular about who they onboard. 62 mergers/acquisitions over last period. 

There is anxious tension in the hearts and minds of leaders doing change management. Hasn't had a point of clarity to help them address it. Nobody trusts anybody. Scientists, facts, truth, neighbors. Now automation? Damn! This is relief to that anxiety. 

Flux fits well, too. Buyers: anxiety, but better way forward? Stuck in the anxiety? 
Positioning: go after the fear or go after the future. 
Client profile: focus on future and LT view of change. Sense of rolling epochs. 
Cos still trying to work out WFH or BTW? Can I trust you when I can't see you? Am I coming in to office to sit in phone booth on Zooms? 
To a company, all are implementing some level of AI into everyone's daily work. Copilot, AI Zoom summaries, all deadlines slashed for presentations, etc. 
All paddling to keep head above water, instead of proficient swimmer. 
Seasoned leaders know this is a big change moment, need to step out of the fray. 

Find leaders who understand this. Nervous that competition is the big consultants. They have the problem, too. They sell more of what they know how to do. They don't have this IP. This is a learn/sense/develop journey, not follow the manual. 
Imagine Flux rolled out enterprise wide. 
Orgs that buy into the big consultants' institutional thinking will be *worse off*
Not fit for the future. 

How to attract high-functioning orgs? 
Mission-driven companies like AARP. 
He sent my materials + Edelman study to Consortium members, suggesting they bring me back in. 
This is a Darwinian moment of Evolve or Die 
Won't invest in anything I don't trust. You won't get the best of me unless I believe in our mission. 
Building that mission is crucial. 
This is robust, unique, timely, strong. 
There's a superhero team collected on this call to do big things. 
OpenWave sent 30 execs to Pacific Institute, which was great. 

When faced with existential threats, we look for trust. First inside, looking at all memories, beliefs for way to dig out. We don't even see things inside to trust!
