### Pro Tip
Let the beef–onion mixture rest for a few minutes before serving — it deepens the flavor. When ladled over the udon, its sweet-savory glaze melds into the broth for luxurious warmth.

### Notes
- **Make ahead:** The broth and beef-onion mixture can be made a few hours in advance. Reheat gently before serving.
- **Flavor boosters:** Try adding a small pat of butter to the broth or a drizzle of miso tare for an even richer winter variation.
