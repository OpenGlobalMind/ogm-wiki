# The NeoBooks Wishlist: ATproto Apps to Create 
(draft)
*What apps would we like to see exist in the ATmosphere?* 

One of the core architectural ideas of the NeoBooks project is [[Separating Data from Apps]], so that the data can be shared across apps, rather than be captive to each app. 

In this way, each app is a use-specific viewer and editor, which can manipulate and improve the underlying, shared layer of [[Warm Data]]. 

Another core architectural principle is obeying protocols that facilitate interoperability and data sharing. A recent entry into this space is the [ATproto](https://atproto.com/) protocol that the Twitter replacement [Bluesky](https://blueskyweb.xyz/) is built atop. The emergent ecosystem around this protocol is sometimes called the ATmosphere. 

Here are several ATproto apps we can easily imagine for the NeoBooks project: 

- [[Wish List NeoBook Dashboard]] (compare with Scrivener, for writing books)
- [[Wish List NeoDeck]] (compare with PowerPoint or Keynote, for creating presentations) 
- [[The NeoBrain]] (compare with TheBrain, for curating context webs) 

It turns out that Generative AI is really good at coding, so we will experiment with coding these apps ourselves. Go to each project page to find those experiments.
