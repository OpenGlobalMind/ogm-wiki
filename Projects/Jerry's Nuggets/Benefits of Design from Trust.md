# Benefits of Design from Trust

Designing systems from a starting assumption that most people want the system to improve has many benefits. Some benefits are easy to intuit; others are hard to see. Some are monetary; others create other kinds of value, from goodwill to innovation. Combined, they are substantive and occasionally transformational: some things that show up with trust can't be replicated in systems lacking trust. Those examples will be most notable at the end of this section, talking about genius and "scenius."
