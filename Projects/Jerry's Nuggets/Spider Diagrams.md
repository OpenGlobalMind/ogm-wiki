# Spider Diagrams

We would like to display projects according to their features in a way that facilitates comparison. One way to do that is with "spider" or "radar" diagrams, like this: [[Spider Graph.excalidraw]] 

Clearly spider diagrams have broader uses; yay! 

Important to this project is agreeing on what the dimensions of a diagram are. For that quick illustration, the dimensions are: 

- Quoting
- Paraphrasing
- ML
- NLP
- Tagging
- Openness
- Linking
