# Useful Thinking Frameworks and Mental Models
(draft) 
*A visual resource you can interact with.*

If you subscribe to Shane Parrish's [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/) newsletter, you are likely familiar with his fascination with mental models. In fact, in 2019 he started publishing [The Great Mental Models](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P79P8ST/jerrymichalskisr), which now runs four volumes. 

I've been fascinated with ideas and mental models, too, but I collect them in a different way: in my [[Jerry's Brain|Brain]], slowly, building context over time. 

This is what happens when [[Knowledge Should Accumulate|knowledge accrues]], as it is meant to. 

This is also only an example of one person's knowledge accruing. The process is more powerful when groups do it. 

In my Brain, each Thought records several dates as metadata. I didn't create this big collective thought until October 2015, but many of the models now under it predate it. For example, I added the OODA Loop in 2004 and the Cynefin framework in 2008. Russ Ackoff's Idealized Redesign went in way back in 1998, very early in my use of TheBrain.

Here's a direct link to [Useful Thinking Frameworks and Mental Models]() in my Brain, and here's what that map looks like, trapped on this page: 

I'd love to know what models you prefer and what models I've missed, how I might arrange these differently, and what stories you might tell around these items.
