# This Kamala Moment

It's been one week since Joe Biden took the courageous step to withdraw from the 2024 Presidential election, endorsing his Vice President in the process. 

It's safe to say the intervening week has surprised many. On the Left, it's been a bit like that revival scene in Pulp Fiction:

On the Right, it's been a bit of a fall from the high of Trump's surviving an assassination attempt in a cinematic manner worthy of Tarantino (again?) or Scorsese, combined with the Trump-family-scripted Republican convention. MAGAs were pretty sure a second Trump Reich was nigh, which would get rid of those pesky elections, reporters and Democrats. 

Weird how much change one week can bring. 

Now there are 98 days until Election Day. 

It's worth pointing out that it took a mere 44 days from when UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak inexplicably called a snap election to his *having to move out of 10 Downing Street!* For being our stodgy elders, the Brits sure moved quickly! Hats off to you!  
## Whither now? 

Back in the US, it seems there are two paths ahead to Election Day. The first has the Democrats' enthusiasm waning, their usual internecine battles rising, and the election becoming a nail-biting squeaker. 

The other path has the Democrats building from this fever pitch and sourcing a miracle blowout. (At this moment, I don't see a blowout the other direction.) But to achieve this, Democrats will have to break some norms and expectations. 

Want to win lasting loyalty? 

1. Admit that some Democratic initiatives are flawed, and could use a collective re-think. 
2. Start some public processes for those re-thinks.
3.
