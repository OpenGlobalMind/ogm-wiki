# Intertwingled Narratives

[[The Big Picture]] is pretty big; explaining it is a challenge. 

Using the framework of [[Nuggets, Narratives, and Points of View]], Jerry has designed some Intertwingled Narratives to take a swing at such explanations. 

These Narratives include: 

- Cyborgs  
- Strategy  
- NeoBooks  
- [[The Big Sentence]]  (which melds many of these narratives)  
- The Big Picture  
- The Big Fungus  
- Design from Trust 
- The Betterverse
