# The Sharing Economy Was Different before Uber Got Its First First Big VC Round

Internet-connected computers made resource sharing vastly easier than before; smartphones with apps gave it another bump. All of a sudden, large numbers of people could list their idle assets to share or rent. And share they did, because it makes sense to do, once the costs of connection fall. 

[ZipCar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipcar), [Zimride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimride), and [CouchSurfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchSurfing) were early examples of how the Sharing Economy might improve our lives. There was reason to be very optimistic. 

Then [Ãœbercab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber) showed up, pretty quickly landing a hefty amount of venture funding on the bet that seizing the well-funded first-mover advantage in ride sharing would hold globally. Uber wasn't the first mover, but it was the first mover with a budget big enough to show up everywhere. It was also an arrogant, sharp-elbowed actor in the market, betting that becoming popular with citizens everywhere would let it circumvent governments everywhere. Sometimes that worked, sometimes it really pissed cities or countries off. 

Ride-sharing coops like [Juno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(company)) never stood a chance.
