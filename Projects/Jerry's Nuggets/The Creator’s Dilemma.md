# The Creator’s Dilemma

You're a creator in modern Western society. You create novels, paintings, songs, poems, screenplays, librettos and more. You've just made your latest work, and you love it. Almost automatically, you face the following dilemma:

- On the one hand, you would like your new work to find its way to the most humans it could please or influence. 
- On the other, you'd like to make a living from this work. 

See the dilemma? Has it troubled you before? 

The "normal" answer is to sell access to works like sticks of bubble gum, which then requires taking measures to make sure that one instance of the work isn't replicated endlessly for free, or otherwise 

The Gift. 

In 2013 I posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2kQx4P7g08) explaining the dilemma.
