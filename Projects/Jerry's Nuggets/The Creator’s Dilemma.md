# The Creatorâ€™s Dilemma

You're a creator in modern Western society. You create novels, paintings, songs, poems, screenplays, librettos and more. Almost automatically, you face the following dilemma:

- On the one hand, you would like your new work to find its way to the most humans it could please or influence. 
- On the other, you'd like to make a living from this work. 



In 2013 I posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2kQx4P7g08) explaining the dilemma.
