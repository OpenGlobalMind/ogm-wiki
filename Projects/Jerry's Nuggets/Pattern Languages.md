# Pattern Languages

[Pattern languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language) are collections of distilled wisdom, usually bounded by a domain, such as meeting facilitation, digital literacy or urban planning. Put a different way, quoting the book A Pattern Language, "A pattern is a careful description of a perennial solution to a recurring problem."

An easy way to understand and remember them is to read the name of a very popular pattern from the ur-pattern book: [Light on Two Sides of Every Room](http://www.patternlanguage.com/apl/aplsample/apl159/apl159.htm). Visit that page to read the whole pattern description, but you get some of its intent from the name. If you're designing a house or building, you should try to get windows on at least two walls of every room. It's not a rule, it's a rule of thumb — a suggestion, based on hard-earned wisdom. 

As part of [[Level Up Media]], we would like to help [[Turbocharge Pattern Languages]]. To that end, we've defined a [[Tiles|Tile]] called [[Tile - 1-2-4-All Zoom App|1-2-4-All Zoom App]] that will demonstrate what we mean. After that, we can generalize the process and apply it to many more patterns.
