# Separate Applications from Data

Gaining [[Multiplayer Sensemaking]] capacity will require some intentional design. 

For example, one way of gaining interoperability is to break the application silos that most data lives in, replacing it with a data layer of [metaphorical soil](https://theconnector.substack.com/p/data-as-the-new-soil-not-oil). 

Seen this way, applications are like lenses floating above the data-as-soil layer. Each application sees the data that it is capable of seeing, ignoring the rest. And each can improve the data that it touches. 

In that way, one Roam user can improve a node about Sensemaking, which will show up when a Tana user looks at the same data â€” all assuming they have permissions that permit that exchange.
