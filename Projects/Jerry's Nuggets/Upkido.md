# Upkido (a practice)
(draft) 
*Improve everything you touch.* 

What do you get when you cross uplift (or Upward Spiral) with the Japanese martial art of Aikido? 

That's the idea behind Upkido, a practice that seeks to improve everything it touches. 

Some readers will notice right away that "improve" isn't the most solid word to build a practice on. What I think will be an improvement may not seem like one to you, never mind to other parties affected by the "improvement." So we should be careful here. 

The [[Principles of Design from Trust]] are very helpful here. 

and [[Jerry's Theory of Change]].
