# Level Up Media

Today's Internet/Web are [stuck in MSM-land](https://youtube.com/shorts/yT0r6D1h_iQ?feature=share) (mainstream media metaphors)
- Early movies filmed theater
- Then filmmakers innovated, inventing the language of cinema (pan, zoom, jump cut, montage)
- The Web now emulates magazine articles, radio shows, TV and movies. Old media. 

We're at a moment where we can level up, transforming media.

Leveling up media will help us [[Save Civilization]] together.

The Copyright Industries will fight this.

Our early experiments to level up media include:

- NeoBooks
- Curating [[The Big Fungus 2]] Together
- A Meta Pattern Language
