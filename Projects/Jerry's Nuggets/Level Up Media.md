# Level Up Media
(draft) 
*Helping ideas get unstuck.* 

In 2022, I posted [[The Internet Is Stuck in Mainstream Media Metaphors]]. The argument was roughly this: 

- Early movies filmed theater, which was familiar.  
- Then filmmakers innovated, inventing the language of cinema: pan, zoom, jump cut, montage.  
- The Web now emulates magazine articles, radio shows, TV and movies. Old media. 
- Much more is possible. 

We're at a moment where we can level up, transforming media.

Leveling up media will help us [[Save Civilization]] together.

The Copyright Industries will likely fight this. [[The Creatorâ€™s Dilemma]]. 

To level up media, let's: 

- Create [[The NeoBooks Manifesto|NeoBooks]] 
- Present Using [[NeoDecks]] 
- Curate [[The Big Fungus]] together 
- [[Turbocharge Pattern Languages]] 
- Neuter Social Media's Addictive Business Model
