# Level Up Media

Today's Internet/Web are [stuck in mainstream media metaphors](https://youtube.com/shorts/yT0r6D1h_iQ?feature=share) 

- Early movies filmed theater  
- Then filmmakers innovated, inventing the language of cinema (pan, zoom, jump cut, montage)  
- The Web now emulates magazine articles, radio shows, TV and movies. Old media.  

We're at a moment where we can level up, transforming media.

Leveling up media will help us [[Save Civilization]] together.

The Copyright Industries will likely fight this.

Our early experiments to level up media include:

- NeoBooks  
- Curating [[The Big Fungus]] Together  
- A Meta Pattern Language
