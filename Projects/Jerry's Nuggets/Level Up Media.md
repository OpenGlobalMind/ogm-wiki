# Level Up Media

- Today's Internet/Web are [stuck in MSM-land](https://youtube.com/shorts/yT0r6D1h_iQ?feature=share) (mainstream media metaphors)
	- Early movies filmed theater
	- Then filmmakers innovated, inventing the language of cinema (pan, zoom, jump cut, montage)
	- The Web now emulates magazine articles, radio shows, TV and movies. Old media. 
- We're at a moment where we can level up, transforming media.
- Leveling up media will help us [[Save Civilization]] together.
- The Copyright Industries will fight this.
