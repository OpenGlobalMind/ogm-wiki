# NeoBooks are Mushrooms of The Big Fungus

Not a sentence you expected to see, eh?

As background, [[Mushrooms Are the Fruiting Bodies of Mycelium]]. We think mushrooms are the fungi, but they are just the visible parts of large networks of hyphae that inhabit healthy soil â€” and help it get healthier. 

In a broad metaphoric coup, we've adopted [[The Big Fungus]] as a fruitful representation of the shared knowledge we wish existed more explicitly in the world. Think of it as a layer that lives above Google and Wikipedia. 

[[NeoBooks Introduction|NeoBooks]] are media experiments to make books more accessible, useful, and vibrant. As books, NeoBooks are the visible fruits of collaborations happening across The Big Fungus. As this metaphor implies, there is a lot of activity happening "underground," in what we hope to be analogous to healthy thinking soil.
