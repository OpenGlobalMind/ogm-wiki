(draft) 
*In so many ways* 

Governments around the world have been having a bit of a problem with citizen uprisings. It seems citizens are around the world are angry about their governments' failing to provide a good present or a better future.

From the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street, the Tea Party, MAGA, Cacerolazos, Cinque Stelle, Gilets Jaunes, School Strikes for Climate Change, and Extinction Rebellion, people feel like the social contract has broken. Like their children's lives will be worse than their own. Like nobody can be trusted. Like working hard within the system no longer pays off.
