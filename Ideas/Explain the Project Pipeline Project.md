# Explain the Project Pipeline Project

Using OGM Wiki, document the pipeline:

1. a header in [[Unsorted Ideas]]
1. a paragraph or two in Unsorted Ideas
1. graduate to its own page in the Ideas folder
1. (more discussion about idea on page and in chat, calls, etc.)
1. (requirements analysis turns ideas into goal language)
1. a Project Plan is created
1. graduate to from Ideas folder to Project folder
1. graduate to a separate Project wiki

Consider:

- related projects (maybe a "see also" section and links to the other projects?)
- tagging projects
