# Cerebro's Superpowers

Can it: 
- Clean up URLs I drag in, correcting naming, changing the favicon?
- Improve the layout and connectivity of a node/screen? Where are the boundaries? 
- Act on things it receives through Brainbox? 
- Talk to me and hear me? 
- Store and retrieve my previous chats? 
- Use the Notes field as slides in a deck? 
- Let Muggles access my Brain? 

Are you eating all those tokens? Future business model there? 
Can I copy part of one Brain into my main Brain, finding and connecting to existing links?
