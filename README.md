## For Publishing Wiki To Website

### Massive Wiki Builder

**THIS FOLLOWING IS AN ADVANCED TOPIC.** You do not need the following information if you just want to edit your wiki.

You can use [Massive Wiki Builder](https://github.com/peterkaminski/massivewikibuilder) to publish (export) any Massive Wiki to static HTML files. The wiki is then in a format viewable by anyone with a web browser.

Massive Wiki Builder (MWB) and [Massive Wiki Themes](https://github.com/peterkaminski/massive-wiki-themes) are included in this repo as Git submodules.

If your website host has build automation, you can adapt the included `netlify.toml` file to drive the build automation, and the build automation should automatically use the Git submodule mechanism to retrieve the MWB code it will need.

If you are using MWB locally on your computer, you will need to retrieve MWB, and optionally, the themes.

When cloning this repo using Git, you can use the `--recurse-submodules` flag to also clone the Massive Wiki Builder and Massive Wiki Themes submodules.

The full command:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Massive-Wiki/massive-wiki-starter.git
```

Or, you can clone the submodules with these commands:

```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

See the [Submodules chapter of the Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for more information about Git submodules.

### Themes

This starter wiki is set up with two MWB / MWT themes, Alto and Basso, in the `.massivewikibuilder/this-wiki-themes` folder. We suggest you continue to use and customize your wiki's themes in the `this-wiki-themes` folder.

The Massive Wiki Themes repo is updated from time to time, and when you refresh your local Git submodule in `.massivewikibuilder/massive-wiki-themes`, you'll receive those updates. Rather than use those themes directly, though, it is suggested to copy what you want into your `this-wiki-themes` folder, and customize and use your copy of the themes from there.
