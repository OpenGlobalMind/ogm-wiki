## People
who are the people working on this project? who can I ask for more information? how can I best get in touch with them?

## Approach
what is the overall strategy for accomplishing this project?
- This project will consist of a interview series show. We will interview subject matter experts as well as tool and process guests. Our aim is to discuss not only what the pressing issues of our time are, but how people are adressing them in both theory and practice.
- We will harvest/improve the content of those interviews, weaving it into multiple persistent memory streams (one of which is Jerry's Brain).
- The meta part of the project is applying the tools to the content and community, all while improving the tools and processes.
