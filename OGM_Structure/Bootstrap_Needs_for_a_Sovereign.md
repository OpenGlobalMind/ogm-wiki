# Bootstrap needs for a sovereign
In OGM and its sister organizations, a "sovereign" is an entity, for- or not-for-profit, that has leadership and presence enough to be addressed and make decisions about its future. 

This list is a starting point for what a sovereign ought to have:

- a good name
- web presence
- persistent async messaging (e.g., chat channel, email list)
- document library (e.g., wiki, Notion, Google Docs)
- project management tools (e.g., wiki, Notion, Airtable, and others)
- charter (mission / vision)
- who we are (at least leadership, and contact info)
- roles we need to fill
- fundraising we've started (here's a endpoint to donate to, here's what we're trying to fund)

In order to put this idea to practical use here, please use this [[Sovereign Template]] to fill out these answers for your sovereign. Create a copy of the template, save it in the Organizations directory here under your organization's name, and go to town.
