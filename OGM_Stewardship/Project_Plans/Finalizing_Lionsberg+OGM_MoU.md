## Due Diligence Around Steward Ownership
- do a short tour of other possible models
- does a 501(c)3 create a bunch of paperwork, more than we can do?

## Due Diligence Around Lionsberg

## Agreeing Collectively to Take Responsibility for MoU Commitments 

## Finalize and Sign MoU
- Jordan to grab OFC values and alignment section and insert
	- Pete to give Jordan a DOCX and Jordan to give back
- meet with Lionsberg General Counsel
- sign document with Lionsberg (4/6)

## Follow-On Action Items / Plans

- Discuss who/how many are quorum for which classes of decisions, for when we need to make definite decisions, potentially more frequently than once per week. (Bootstrap governance / Governance Plan)
- Start OGM Program/Project Management Tool Decision Plan (between Massive, Notion, Airtable, + whatever else).
- Decide how/when to move most Stewardship operations back into the public channels rather than Inner Circle.

## Infrastructure for MoU Work

- ~~create Inner Circle Stewards Wiki~~
- get team members up on Obsidian and connected to OGM Wiki
    - ~~Jerry~~
    - Charles
    - Judy
    - anybody else?
