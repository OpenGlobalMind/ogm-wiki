<h1>Jerry's GDoc OGM Engagement Proposal for Lionsberg</h1>
<p><em>from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1edMrE3z77MFe2RA4ouLUmSFoAHWdtK_NUpHz2OQkcOA/edit?usp=sharing">Google Docs</a></em></p>
<p><strong>OGM Engagement Proposal for Lionsberg</strong></p>
<p>March 2021</p>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Open Global Mind, currently a community of practice, seeks to become a platform for tktk.</p>
<h2>OGM’s <strong>Mission</strong></h2>
<p>In one sentence: Helping humans make better decisions together.</p>
<p>Alternative: Navigating humbly in community toward truth.</p>
<p>Alternative: Helping humans coalesce into effective sovereign entities, individually and collectively.</p>
<p>Assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are in the middle of <a href="https://bra.in/3qe4my">five crises</a>, give or take.</li>
<li>Discourse at large is broken. We are stuck in logjams, unable to work together on important issues.</li>
<li>Some actors are intentionally undermining discourse and trust.</li>
<li>This process has widened a global <a href="https://bra.in/7p7yJj">cultural divide</a>, making things worse.</li>
<li>Our lack of a shared memory <a href="https://bra.in/4jobaY">makes us amnesic</a>, dumber, easier to manipulate.</li>
<li><a href="https://bra.in/2vPB9q">Emotion and membership trump reason most of the time</a>.</li>
<li>Business is more political than businesses would like to admit.</li>
<li>We need better tools and techniques for sharing stories, facts and points of view.</li>
<li>Those tools need to interoperate, as well as share trustworthy, linked, contextual data.</li>
<li>The tools, techniques and data need to be as open and accessible as possible.</li>
<li>Our platform needs to be credible and durable.</li>
<li>That means it needs to help its participants make a living through their participation.</li>
<li>We (OGM) don’t have the best answers, but can help those who do (while absorbing their insights).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://bra.in/7v2e46">Useful Metaphors</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>OGM is an estuary where nutrients feed different groups, who innovate together.</li>
<li>OGM is like colonies of farmer ants, who tend to a fungus that feeds them all.</li>
<li>OGM is part of a growing ecosystem of organizations prototyping the next economy.</li>
<li>OGM reaches across to other organizations like mycelial hyphae, making contact and exchanging nutrients. We are part of a virtual <a href="https://bra.in/6jL4WY">Wood Wide Web</a>.</li>
<li>In order to re-weave the fabric of society, OGM is helping weave a global brain.</li>
<li>OGM uses Jerry’s Brain as <a href="https://bra.in/3vGQz9">sourdough starter</a>, to stimulate creation of that global brain.</li>
</ul>
<h2>OGM’s <strong>Secret Sauce</strong></h2>
<p>OGM aims to spark collective intelligence by offering meta value:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t come up with the best solution to climate change, capitalism or racism: We help those who have fabulous solutions represent, share, pitch, connect and scale theirs.</li>
<li>We don’t build the One Platform to Rule Them All: We help those who are building great platforms and apps  interoperate, open up and find new models for thriving while sharing.</li>
<li>We don’t build the world’s most credible database: We promote distributed, contextual, linked, warm, reliable data.</li>
<li>We weave knowledge, software and people.</li>
<li>We provide bridges and interconnections (we introduce and connect individuals and groups).</li>
<li>We offer curated solution sets at all levels, in all domains.</li>
<li>Booster rockets.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What OGM Is Building</strong></h2>
<p>We envision the following five layers for OGM to build out:</p>
<ol>
<li>Infrastructure</li>
<li>Governance</li>
<li>Knowledge</li>
<li>Services</li>
<li>Contagion</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Explaining the Layers</strong></h2>
<p>All of these have our shared vision and culture woven through them.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Infrastructure</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To nurture the building of a shared collective sensemaking infrastructure. Prototype, model and share it out. Find relevant open source software, test and integrate it. Reach out to the developers.</p>
<p>How do we help groups move forward into a shared understanding.</p>
<ul>
<li>place to share understanding</li>
<li>place to talk about understanding</li>
<li>google group, discourse, csc mattermost, google docs</li>
<li>experiments in building/hosting/using infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p>Preference for open source software</p>
<ul>
<li>prefer to use OSS</li>
<li>bias vendors of proprietary tools to be friendly / move towards OSS</li>
</ul>
<p>Preference for distributed tools</p>
<p>Separate out the data layer</p>
<p>Interoperability</p>
<p>Each of the layers is also infrastructure.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Governance</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to become more useful in its mission, OGM needs visible organization, values and methods. It also needs a legal structure, and people willing to occupy roles with responsibility for the whole.</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>charity or not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Officers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The not-GANNTT-charty thing we use for coordinating what we’re doing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of Onboarding Process for organizations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typology of Inter-organizational relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>List of 6 other orgs, approach them, report on how it went, post-mortem (some friendlies, some not)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or, list of known orgs to approach, plus deliverable of identifying X number of unknown orgs as well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a commitment to work on governance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a plan for same</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Knowledge</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The “mother” of OGM’s knowledge web is Jerry’s Brain, but it is just the start. Federation of mothers. Federation of peers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Services and Products</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Business models for those services. What services? What values do they have to uphold?</p>
<p>Metrics of trust. Stakeholders…. Edelman Trust. Glassdoor. Yelp.  Brands as proxy for trust.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Contagion</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Upward spiral. “I’ll have what she’s having.” Modeling.</p>
<h2><strong>For This Six-Month Sprint</strong></h2>
<p>TECH / INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Shared collective sensemaking infrastructure - backbone<span class="incipient-wikilink">a\</span>(#cmnt1) - built by different people - know what we know, set up great experiments… and thereby change how education, governance, corporate decision making… Building and modeling the technical infrastructure for sharing what we know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outreach group / method / process - going to Rome research community… distributed web people… and out to facilitation communities… Looping in a variety of communities…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not - building a platform that everyone will use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But - bringing together into something interoperable and useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hosting convos that lead us to designing experiments, writing code (massive Wiki - separating out data so it looks like wiki to wiki engine, but PowerPoint to PowerPoint engine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we navigate towards Truth in community<span class="incipient-wikilink">b\</span>(#cmnt2)…. And then understand the right wise thing to DO in light of what we have come to know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have lost control of the ability to dialogue and navigate towards truth…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is crucial to our survival as a species… because we have to understand and solve the global grand challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This effort has been co-opted corporations and political instructions - we are at risk of existing in ideological filter bubbles that will increasingly keep us separated and enslaved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Platform and protocol for navigating towards Truth for the wellbeing of All…</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>GOVERNANCE LAYER:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Governance of collective information / knowledge / wisdom / associated infrastructure… <span class="incipient-wikilink">c\</span>(#cmnt3)</li>
<li>NOT - individual or corporate ownership… hence - free Jerry’s brain…</li>
<li>What is OGMy… how does it manifest in social / cultural / legal / technological protocols - that ensure trust and interoperability… among all platforms moving in the support of the Meta Goal…</li>
<li>Facilitation and convening of this conversation on social / cultural / legal / tech protocols for the open future…</li>
<li>It is unethical to own and manipulate information for corporate, political, or national gain… Because - it is essentially lying… which destroys trust and divides… and eliminates our ability to collectively discern the wise right thing to do…</li>
<li>Calling BS on the corporate and political and media platforms that are opaquely manipulating and controlling the public discourse…</li>
<li>Actively… modeling and prototyping both platform and governance in a very active and continuously improving manner…</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>KNOWLEDGE LAYER:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Mining and Organization of Knowledge… As the meta project dialogue unfolds - the mining and organization of collective plans and knowledge in the commons… that can be transparently seen, interacted with, improved by the global community… Charles - the mining and organization of the knowledge that emerges from facilitated conversations…</li>
<li>Machine learning and also rhythms - synthesize what got said, how it connects to the broader cloud of everyone is thinking…</li>
<li>Ethical frameworks for using the right tech…</li>
<li>Building the Open Global Mind that can collectively discern Truth, the wise right thing to do, and how to execute on it…</li>
<li>Mining and weaving… establishing norms and processes for getting to shared understanding… how we deal with convo, tag it up, link to context it, enrich it…</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>SERVICE LAYER:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Facilitating, convening, consulting (Service Layer)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>CONTAGION LAYER</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Modeling and Contagion - (wraps in the speeches and consulting etc.) Being out in public, using it, and doing it. What it is like, what it feels like</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A precursor to Trust is (the ability / process to humbly navigate towards Truth in community… antidote to Ideology… bottom up citizen science…)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Problem with Wikipedia - single canonical page… behind the scenes - haggling about canonical way…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Huge chunk - that is deep listening and respecting one another… Listening with respect. Being present, offering dignity, presenting peace and facilitating peace - navigating together is more important than truth part…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowing what is not - dissolving the negative rather than painting the positive…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positive - in the form of hypothesis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negative - what is not… Dissolving what isn’t and what is keeping us apart…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guilds within OGM - mapped to craft, durable, bringing in new, training apprentice to journeyman to master, and responsible for improving the trade and making it broadly useful and accessible… not guild secrets…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OGM Guilds…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Map Whisperers - gifted at using brain, kumu, miro - map issues, tell stories…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>StoryThreaders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LiFe on other planets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Role - find employment for members… or fellowship, rewards, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magnet and focal point for the craft as a thing to do to make a living…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rethinking how we treat assets, ideas, and ownership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do guilds bubble up into the meta - and work as openly as possible - so they bubble up outside and are available to … bias towards openly… working wikily…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consultancy -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>could employ people of various guilds…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quests - time bounded important and interesting projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Top 3 objections</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contradictory - why are you describing businesses we would start up, vs. infrastructure and other stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commons - platform, the ideas, the knowledge, the governance… Open Source Space…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service Layer - leveraging of the platform - into services and helping others leverage the platform…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contagion Layer -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If businesses - half of this should be marketing…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OGM is moving towards building something that is not represented here…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actually and literally attempting to make a wise open global mind…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brain and neural network for humanity…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending and receiving of accurate information to the global community…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Friendly docking system with other cultures and points of view… very absorbent and receptive to others…</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="incipient-wikilink">a\</span>(#cmnt_ref1)I have no idea what this means. What kind of infrastructure?</p>
<p><span class="incipient-wikilink">b\</span>(#cmnt_ref2)this is so vague that it loses meaning.</p>
<p><span class="incipient-wikilink">c\</span>(#cmnt_ref3)This is so broad that I could not possibly tell anyone else what OGM was working on.</p>
