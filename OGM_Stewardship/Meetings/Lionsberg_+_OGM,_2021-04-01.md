## Stewards Action Items

### Getting to Lionsberg+OGM meeting on time
- (re)formatting the check-in call
- starting to wrap the call earlier

### Culture and Values (values, shared values)
- we're good enough for now with the MoU
- culture operationalize and keep abstract values going for the long-term
- Charles: maybe just add a line or two saying that it infuses all five layers
- no legal document that can bind for the long-term, it's only culture 

if there's not a shared vision or north star, the people dissolve
- determining whether we're moving towards the same north star or not
- "Vision" / shared vision
- vision and values system
	- continual refreshing

how we manifest what we say we believe
"performative contradiction"

north star
- Pacific Islander navigation includes many things other than stars
- [[Commander's Intent]]
	- discern intent
	- Lean
	- Construction
	- Navigating towards truth (highest good or intention that we can conceptualize)

hold an orientation (to highest good we can conceive)
- stacking layers of questing

quest harmonization

[[Le Go√ªt de la Mer]]

jazz

highest intention
- milestones
- iteration

honoring, amplifying, harmonizing

fully-developed consciousness to emerge
