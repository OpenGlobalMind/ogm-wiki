## Agenda

- Present [[Appendix A - Sprint 1 Statement of Work]].
    - get feedback
- Review our [marked-up legal section]() (link redacted).
- Ask Jordan about what _needs_ to be in the MOU and what can be in separate vision documents.
- Review composition of Stewards Team.

## Meeting Notes

- recapping last call
    - grew and learned
- where we're at as a team
    - Charles, Lauren, Judy, Jerry, Pete, Matt
- structure
    - hypotheses, moving to better and better answers
    - all funds go to production of non-profit assets
- creating a map off all the possible problem sets (00:29)
    - focusing on a few specific problem sets
    - what are the hypotheses and questions _we_ are exploring / trying to solve
    - what are the hypotheses and questions _others in our networks_ are exploring / trying to solve
    - flotilla of sovereigns may be more attractive to funding partners (00:43)
		- (note later: ref [[Doughnut Economics]])
- new MOU structure (00:47)
    - short legal MOU, pragmatic fiscal sponsorship relationship
        - purposes of orgs, why we are aligning
    - appendix a (or last?): slim, fast SOW; approximate good we want to achieve
        - really, the SOW for this sprint; updated for each sprint
        - release number 1, 2, 3, 4
            - or release names :-)
    - appendix b: cultures and values alignment
    - appendix c: larger, evolving vision document
- can implement a library wiki approach to MOU + sprint plan + culture, values, vision docs
    - Lionsberg Template Wiki for Founding Documents

IP
    - needs to be in the commons (even for-profit)
    - what about attribution?

Administrative Fee
    - covers administrative costs, call it 5%
        - won't cover Lionsberg's costs for low-volume
        - excess funds collected are allocated back into funds to be disbursed
        - percentage doesn't scale with cost #PotentialStructuralBug
            - goal: benefits commons rather than growth
    - separate from Common Infrastructure (tree trunk) structure, or tithing, or etc.
    
Bugs / Features / To Dos
- need to define what the Commmons is
    - Regenerative Economy
    - rules are all provisional until replaced by something better (kind of like Science)
    - different domains around the world will have different solutions needed (e.g., 501\(c\)3 isn't for every nation)

Massive Wiki
- Pete and Jordan to explore The Way of Massive Wiki :-)

Consider Other Lifeforms
- easy to make some more fractal copies at this point

## After Thursday 4/22 Jordan Call

- reintegrate MOU (legal section, [culture and alignment section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HQ6XSRPMbFH0XV31YwKSfmfdB_XrobA4/edit), slim fast SOW, trim anything too flowery)
