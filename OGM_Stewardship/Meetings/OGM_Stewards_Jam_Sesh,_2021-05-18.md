# OGM Stewards Jam Sesh, 2021-05-18

## People

Jerry, Judy, Matt, Vincent, Pete

## OGM Bootstrap Next Steps

- Jerry final pass over MOU
- Jerry sign and pass MOU to Lionsberg
- Jerry recruit for OGM Bootstrap
- we propose to dissolve the OGM Stewards call on next week's call 5/25 (and then reconvening other calls as required to carry on our work)

## Other Sovereign Next Steps

- get going!

## Possible Agenda Topics

- From Lionsberg: MOU + Generative Commons / Community Agreement
- Tool choices: Massive, Notion, Google Docs...
- Whither OGM Stewards
- The Commons, and what that means

Jerry re OGM
- stewarding of the new ecosystem of sovereigns ("flotilla")
- stewarding of particular commons that we come up that aren't being stewarded already ("commons")
- stewarding of OGM and the OGM community ("OGM itself")

Is OGM an organization? (00:46)

"Apostles"
- primary teachers of the message

Dr. Tamsin Woolley-Barker
- "TEEMING: How Superorganisms Work to Build Infinite Wealth in a Finite World"

decentralized, federated, interoperable

"mercantile explosion" (01:10)

(01:12) combination of a vision of the future and a sensibility of how to get there (physically, socially, )
- able to have trust that we can actually get there
- OGM has the most foresight and thoughtfulness of how to get there

OGM is a place where we found each other, to come together, to work on these things

OGM is a verb.

"If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him"
- by Sheldon Kopp

Game B
- a novel discourse and sense-making community framing a needed shift from default human history ("Game A") to a new mode of behavior and social organization that does _not_ reproduce _any_ of the generator functions of existential risk

number of names (01:39)
- "the number of names should be commensurate with the number of (things) you will have in a year"

(Jerry's screed on 'Open Global Mind', 08:43)
