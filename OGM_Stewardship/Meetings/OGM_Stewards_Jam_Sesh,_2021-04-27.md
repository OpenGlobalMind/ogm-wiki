### Wiki Governance

- good wiki structure = good governance
- clarity of definitions

## References / Resources

- [The LAO: A For\-Profit, Limited Liability Autonomous Organization](https://medium.com/openlawofficial/the-lao-a-for-profit-limited-liability-autonomous-organization-9eae89c9669c)
    - Not sure if this is the "LAO" David refers to, but it's a good short history of The DAO, and an explanation of The LAO.  It bears a compare/contrast between the LAO structure and the Lionsberg structure.

## Handling Scale; Decentralization

- How to achieve consensus in a large group of people? (i.e., scale)
- Idea: decentralized federation of focused sovereigns
    - Federation = agreements, commitments, promises between sovereigns.
    - Each sovereign has its own, focused, vision/mission/values around a center of gravity.
    - Sovereigns can be service providers and clients to each other.
    - This is called federated micro-publics in GaiaFests "minimal viable governance model".
        - therefore, "sovereign" = "micro-publics"
- Observations
    - Amorphousness is good.
    - Focus is good.
    - Decentralization and federation provide both amorphousness and focus.
- Tools
    - Scaling while preserving the quality of rich deliberation requires tool support.

## Proposal to Join Forces on Governance Issues

See original proposal at [[Proposal to Join Forces on Governance Issues (GaiaFest)]]

- not a governance model per se, rather a time scale
- short-term process for funding
- (a flotilla of sovereigns/micro-publics forming and doing work that might be, could be hundreds of them)
- mid-term (Nov 21 / June 22), really good process for constitution OGM, GaiaFest
    - 10-15 membership meetings would be needed for good process

"revenue stream" -> "value stream" (where "value" == something that i or someone really care about, a measurable value, value creation)

flotilla
- practical, federation
- each sovereign is a legal entity, with its own form
- an ecosystem of legal entities

quotes
- test: if it's a minimal step, are you ready to burn it down and build something else?
- "'subset of the flotilla' is misleading"
- "governance is about managing conflict"
- "pace matching"
- where do you incorporate the law
- [[Legislative Theatre]]
- "evolution needs something to work with"
