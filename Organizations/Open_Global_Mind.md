### Mission
Open Global Mind brings together theorists, practitioners, and other interested parties to explore and create ways for individuals, organizations, and societies to organize around resolving wicked messes in the service of a future where humanity and other forms of life can thrive for millions of years to come.

### Vision
We are working towards a future where:
- All people everywhere are granted dignity, have access to equal justice under the law, and can find a fulfilling sense of belonging
- Technology supports our ability to remember vital lessons and visualize complex interrelationships in ways that allow us to resolve seemingly intractable problems
- The non-human and more-than-human among us are also represented in our decision-making processes
