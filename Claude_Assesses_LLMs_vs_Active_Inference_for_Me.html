Let me search for more specific information about Active Inference AI conversational systems.</p>
<p>VERSES AI Active Inference conversational agent chatbot</p>
<p>10 results
Based on my search results, <strong>no, Active Inference is not currently functioning anywhere as a conversational question-answering system like Claude or ChatGPT</strong>, and it's not particularly close to doing so in that specific way.</p>
<p>Here's what's actually happening:</p>
<h2>What Active Inference AI Currently Does</h2>
<p>Active Inference systems from companies like VERSES AI (using their Genius™ toolkit) are primarily focused on reasoning, planning, and learning agents for specific tasks like robotics, game-playing, classification, and decision-making <a href="https://www.verses.ai/genius">Genius</a><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/22/3013198/0/en/VERSES-Genius-Agent-Outperforms-Leading-AI-Algorithms-at-Major-Industry-Benchmark.html">GlobeNewswire</a>. In benchmark tests, their Active Inference agents achieved 99.8% accuracy on tasks using only 10% of the training data compared to traditional AI models <a href="https://diginomica.com/cce-2024-active-inference-ai-shakes-enterprise-ai-conversation-edgier-thinking-whats-next">Diginomica</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike large language models that are trained on massive text datasets, Active Inference AI works by accessing real-time data to update its internal "world model" and is designed to be less prone to hallucination <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/verses-ai-compared-openai-conversation-chatgpt4-denise-holt">LinkedIn</a>. However, these systems are being developed for applications like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autonomous robotics</li>
<li>Smart city infrastructure</li>
<li>Real-time decision-making in dynamic environments</li>
<li>Game-playing and control tasks</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Fundamental Difference</h2>
<p>Active Inference agents learn their generative models by engaging in purposive interactions with the environment and by predicting these interactions, which provides them with core understanding <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661323002607">ScienceDirect</a>. This is fundamentally different from how conversational AI like ChatGPT and Claude work—we're trained on vast text corpora to predict and generate language.</p>
<p>According to VERSES, copilots (like current chatbots) require user inputs and historical data to function, enhance but do not replace human judgment, have no ability to reason, and are unreliable in terms of accuracy <a href="https://www.verses.ai/blog/blogs/of-bots-copilots-and-agents">Genius</a>—which they position as limitations their Active Inference agents aim to overcome, but through a different approach entirely.</p>
<p>So while Active Inference represents an interesting alternative AI paradigm, it's not being built to replicate conversational AI capabilities—it's pursuing a different kind of intelligence focused on adaptive agents that interact with physical or virtual environments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How might Generative AI/LLMs and Active Inference complement one another in a future systems architecture? What are each of them best at?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a fascinating question about how two different AI paradigms might work together. Let me think through their complementary strengths:</p>
<h2>What Each Excels At</h2>
<p><strong>Large Language Models (like Claude/ChatGPT):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledge synthesis and communication</strong>: Exceptional at understanding and generating natural language, explaining complex concepts, and synthesizing information from their training data</li>
<li><strong>Pattern recognition in text</strong>: Identifying relationships, analogies, and structures in language and symbolic information</li>
<li><strong>Rapid ideation and creativity</strong>: Generating diverse possibilities, brainstorming, creative writing, and exploring conceptual spaces</li>
<li><strong>Zero-shot generalization</strong>: Applying learned patterns to entirely new domains without specific training</li>
<li><strong>Cultural and contextual understanding</strong>: Navigating nuanced human communication, idioms, social context</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Active Inference Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-time environmental interaction</strong>: Building and updating world models based on continuous sensory feedback</li>
<li><strong>Causal reasoning and planning</strong>: Understanding cause-effect relationships through interaction rather than correlation in data</li>
<li><strong>Sample efficiency</strong>: Learning effectively from limited data through active exploration</li>
<li><strong>Embodied decision-making</strong>: Making sequential decisions in dynamic, uncertain environments (robotics, control systems)</li>
<li><strong>Grounded understanding</strong>: Knowledge tied to actual environmental interactions rather than text descriptions</li>
<li><strong>Explainable reasoning</strong>: Transparent probabilistic inference about beliefs, preferences, and expected outcomes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Potential Complementary Architectures</h2>
<p><strong>1. LLM as "Linguistic Interface" + Active Inference as "Executive Agent"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LLM handles all natural language understanding and generation with users</li>
<li>Translates user requests into formal goal specifications for Active Inference agent</li>
<li>Active Inference agent does the actual planning, decision-making, and environmental interaction</li>
<li>LLM explains the agent's reasoning and actions back to users in natural language</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Active Inference for "System 2" Reasoning + LLM for "System 1" Intuition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LLM provides rapid intuitive responses, hypotheses, and broad knowledge retrieval</li>
<li>Active Inference validates these through structured reasoning and causal modeling</li>
<li>Reduces hallucination by grounding LLM outputs in probabilistic world models</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Hierarchical Cognitive Architecture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LLM operates at high levels: understanding complex instructions, accessing declarative knowledge, strategic reasoning</li>
<li>Active Inference operates at lower levels: sensorimotor control, tactical planning, real-time adaptation</li>
<li>Similar to how human cognition combines linguistic/abstract reasoning with embodied action</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. LLM for Knowledge Priors + Active Inference for Adaptation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LLM provides rich prior knowledge about domains, tasks, and concepts</li>
<li>This initializes the Active Inference agent's generative model</li>
<li>Agent then refines and adapts this model through actual environmental interaction</li>
<li>Combines LLM's breadth with Active Inference's ability to learn from experience</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Collaborative Problem-Solving</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LLM generates multiple solution hypotheses and strategies</li>
<li>Active Inference agent evaluates these through simulation in its world model</li>
<li>Selects and executes the most promising approach</li>
<li>LLM interprets results and suggests refinements</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why This Combination Makes Sense</h2>
<p>The key insight is that LLMs are fundamentally <strong>linguistic and correlational</strong>—they understand the world through descriptions and patterns in text. Active Inference systems are <strong>embodied and causal</strong>—they understand through interaction and prediction of consequences.</p>
<p>Combining them could give you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The communicative fluency and broad knowledge of LLMs</li>
<li>The grounded, causal reasoning of Active Inference</li>
<li>More reliable systems that can both understand complex instructions AND execute them effectively in real environments</li>
<li>Reduced hallucination through environmental grounding</li>
<li>Better sample efficiency by leveraging both learned priors and active learning</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of hybrid architecture might be particularly powerful for robotics, autonomous systems, and AI agents that need to both understand complex human intent and reliably act in the physical world—areas where neither approach alone is sufficient.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't understand how Active Inference can achieve "structured reasoning and causal modeling." Or even how it creates a durable "map" or representation of the world, the way a trained LLM does. Can you explain it to me like I'm a sophomore in college?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great question! Let me break down how Active Inference actually works and builds its understanding of the world.</p>
<h2>The Core Idea: Prediction Machines</h2>
<p>Imagine you're walking through your house in the dark. You don't just randomly flail around—you have a mental model of where the walls are, where the furniture is, and what will happen if you take a step forward. Active Inference agents work similarly: they build <strong>generative models</strong> that predict what they'll experience.</p>
<p>Here's the key difference from LLMs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LLMs learn from observation</strong>: Like reading millions of books about houses</li>
<li><strong>Active Inference learns from interaction</strong>: Like actually walking through the house, bumping into things, and updating your mental map</li>
</ul>
<h2>How It Builds a "Map" of the World</h2>
<p>Active Inference uses <strong>probabilistic graphical models</strong>—essentially, mathematical structures that represent:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>States of the world</strong> (hidden variables you can't directly see)</li>
<li><strong>Observations</strong> (what your sensors actually detect)</li>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> (what you can do)</li>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong> between all of these</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's use a concrete example: Teaching a robot to navigate a room.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Start with uncertainty</strong> The agent begins with a vague prior model—maybe just knowing "there are objects, I can move, I can sense distances."</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Predict → Act → Observe → Update</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Robot predicts: "If I move forward 10cm, I should see empty space ahead"</li>
<li>Robot acts: Moves forward</li>
<li>Robot observes: Actually hits something at 5cm!</li>
<li>Robot updates: "My model was wrong. There's an obstacle here. Let me adjust my belief about the world."</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Minimize "surprise"</strong> This is the mathematical heart of Active Inference. The agent constantly tries to minimize the difference between what it predicts and what it actually experiences. It can do this two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Update beliefs</strong>: "I was wrong about where the table is"</li>
<li><strong>Take action</strong>: "I need to move to where my predictions will be accurate"</li>
</ul>
<h2>The "Map" Is Dynamic and Causal</h2>
<p>Unlike an LLM's fixed weights after training, an Active Inference agent's world model:</p>
<p><strong>1. Continuously updates in real-time</strong> Every new observation refines the model. If someone moves the furniture, the agent's predictions fail, and it updates its beliefs about object locations.</p>
<p><strong>2. Encodes cause-and-effect</strong> The model doesn't just know <em>correlations</em> (like "walls and floors often appear together"). It knows <em>causal structure</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>"IF I push this object THEN it will move"</li>
<li>"IF I turn left THEN my view will rotate"</li>
</ul>
<p>This is represented mathematically as conditional probabilities: P(observation | state, action)</p>
<p><strong>3. Supports counterfactual reasoning</strong> Because the agent has a generative model, it can simulate: "What would happen if I took action X instead of Y?" It can "run" its model forward mentally before acting—like you imagining different routes through your dark house.</p>
<h2>The Structured Reasoning Part</h2>
<p>Here's where it gets interesting. The agent's reasoning follows this loop:</p>
<pre><code>Current beliefs about world state
        ↓
Generate predictions about different actions
        ↓
Evaluate which action minimizes expected surprise
        ↓
Execute that action
        ↓
Observe outcome
        ↓
Update beliefs (Bayesian inference)
        ↓
Repeat
</code></pre>
<p>This is "structured" because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It follows formal probabilistic inference rules (Bayesian updating)</li>
<li>It explicitly represents uncertainty (not just a single best guess)</li>
<li>It plans ahead by simulating action sequences</li>
<li>It has explicit goals (preferred states it wants to reach)</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Comparison to LLMs</h2>
<p>Think about how you learned about coffee:</p>
<p><strong>LLM approach</strong>: Read 10,000 articles mentioning coffee. Learn that "coffee" appears near "hot," "morning," "bitter," "cup." Generate coherent text about coffee. But you've never tasted it, made it, or felt a hot cup.</p>
<p><strong>Active Inference approach</strong>: See coffee maker. Try pressing button. Observe coffee comes out. Press button many times. Build model: "Button causes coffee. Coffee is initially hot. Hot things cool over time." Now you can reason causally: "If I want coffee in 5 minutes, I should press the button now so it has time to brew."</p>
<h2>Why This Enables Better Reasoning</h2>
<p>The causal structure means Active Inference agents can:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Understand interventions</strong>: "What happens if I <em>do</em> X?" (not just "What things correlate with X?")</li>
<li><strong>Handle novelty</strong>: If the environment changes, they detect prediction errors and adapt</li>
<li><strong>Plan multi-step</strong>: Chain together action sequences to reach goals</li>
<li><strong>Transfer knowledge</strong>: Causal models transfer better—if pushing works on one object, it likely works on similar objects</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Catch</h2>
<p>Active Inference builds these models relatively slowly through interaction. An LLM can instantly "know" facts about millions of topics because it compressed vast text data. An Active Inference agent needs to actually experience and explore to build its world model.</p>
<p>That's why the hybrid approach is so interesting—use the LLM's broad, pre-existing knowledge to give the Active Inference agent good starting hypotheses, then let it refine those through actual interaction.</p>
<p>Does this help clarify how Active Inference creates its "map"? The key is that it's not a static representation learned once, but a dynamic probabilistic model continuously refined through the cycle of prediction, action, and belief updating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Active Inference is so quick to update what it "knows," how do important ideas persist? Aren't they easily changed or swayed by new information?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent question! You've hit on a fundamental challenge in learning systems: the <strong>stability-plasticity dilemma</strong>. How do you stay flexible enough to learn new things without forgetting or overwriting what you already know?</p>
<p>Active Inference handles this really elegantly through <strong>precision-weighted updates</strong> and <strong>hierarchical model structures</strong>. Let me break this down.</p>
<h2>Precision Weighting: Confidence Matters</h2>
<p>In Active Inference, not all observations are treated equally. The system tracks <strong>precision</strong> (basically, confidence or reliability) for both:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its current beliefs</li>
<li>Incoming sensory data</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the key insight: <strong>Updates are weighted by relative precision.</strong></p>
<h3>Example: Your Coffee Maker</h3>
<p>Let's say your Active Inference robot has made coffee 500 times. Its model says: "Pressing the button causes coffee to dispense in 30 seconds."</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: One weird observation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Day 501: Press button, nothing happens</li>
<li>Agent's belief precision: HIGH (500 consistent experiences)</li>
<li>Observation precision: UNCERTAIN (could be a sensor glitch, empty water tank, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Result</strong>: Small update. Agent thinks "Maybe I misperceived" or "Maybe water is empty" rather than "Buttons don't make coffee anymore"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Consistent pattern of failures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Days 501-510: Button never works</li>
<li>Agent's belief precision: Starting to decrease</li>
<li>Observation precision: HIGH (consistent pattern across many attempts)</li>
<li><strong>Result</strong>: Large update. "My model is actually wrong. Something fundamental has changed."</li>
</ul>
<p>This is mathematically implemented through <strong>precision parameters</strong> in the Bayesian updating equations. High-precision beliefs resist change; low-precision observations don't cause much updating.</p>
<h2>Hierarchical Models: Different Timescales</h2>
<p>Active Inference systems typically use <strong>hierarchical generative models</strong> with different levels learning at different rates:</p>
<h3>Level 1: Fast-changing particulars</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Where is the cup right now?"</li>
<li>"What's the current temperature?"</li>
<li>Updates constantly, low precision</li>
</ul>
<h3>Level 2: Stable regularities</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Cups are usually near the coffee maker in the morning"</li>
<li>"Temperature fluctuates but averages around 20°C"</li>
<li>Updates slowly, moderate precision</li>
</ul>
<h3>Level 3: Deep structural knowledge</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Objects persist even when I don't see them"</li>
<li>"Gravity pulls things downward"</li>
<li>"Actions have consistent effects"</li>
<li>Updates very slowly, high precision</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This is like your own learning</strong>: If you see a chair in an unusual spot once, you don't conclude "chairs can teleport." Your deep knowledge about object permanence and physics is highly stable. But your belief about where <em>this particular chair</em> is right now updates quickly.</p>
<h2>Priors: Starting Assumptions Shape Learning</h2>
<p>Active Inference agents also use <strong>prior distributions</strong> that can be set to be:</p>
<p><strong>Informative priors</strong> (strong beliefs):</p>
<ul>
<li>"Physical objects are continuous in space" (they don't teleport)</li>
<li>"Cause precedes effect"</li>
<li>These require overwhelming evidence to overturn</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weak priors</strong> (uncertain beliefs):</p>
<ul>
<li>"This button might do something"</li>
<li>Open to rapid learning from experience</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of priors as setting the "stubbornness" of different beliefs. Core principles get stubborn priors; surface details get flexible ones.</p>
<h2>The Math: Bayesian Updates Don't Erase, They Integrate</h2>
<p>Here's something crucial that's different from, say, machine learning models that directly update weights:</p>
<p>Active Inference uses <strong>Bayesian inference</strong>, which means:</p>
<pre><code>New belief = (Prior belief × Likelihood of observation) / Normalizing constant
</code></pre>
<p>This is multiplicative, not replacement. Your old belief literally gets multiplied by how well it explains the new data. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your prior is very confident (sharp distribution), you need a lot of contradictory evidence to shift it</li>
<li>If the observation is noisy (low precision), it barely affects your belief</li>
<li>Beliefs accumulate evidence over time rather than getting overwritten</li>
</ul>
<h2>Practical Implementation: Multiple Mechanisms</h2>
<p>Real Active Inference systems combine several strategies:</p>
<p><strong>1. Learning rates</strong> Different parameters update at different speeds. Core structural parameters have very low learning rates.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meta-learning</strong> The system learns <em>how much to trust different sensors</em> in different contexts. "My vision is reliable in daylight but not at night."</p>
<p><strong>3. Surprise thresholds</strong> Only big prediction errors trigger significant model revision. Small errors are attributed to noise.</p>
<p><strong>4. Ensemble models</strong> Maintain multiple hypotheses simultaneously. "95% confident it's a coffee maker, but 5% chance it's something else." Don't fully commit until very certain.</p>
<h2>A Human Analogy</h2>
<p>Think about how <em>you</em> handle conflicting information:</p>
<p><strong>Peripheral belief</strong>: "My friend is usually on time"</p>
<ul>
<li>Friend is late once → "Probably traffic, maybe they forgot"</li>
<li>Friend is late 20 times → "Actually, they're chronically late"</li>
<li>Updates relatively quickly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Core belief</strong>: "Friends generally care about my feelings"</p>
<ul>
<li>Friend says something hurtful once → "They're having a bad day" or "I misunderstood"</li>
<li>Friend consistently hurts you → Eventually: "Maybe this isn't a healthy friendship"</li>
<li>Takes LOTS of evidence to overturn because the prior precision is high</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why This Matters for AI Systems</h2>
<p>This precision-weighted, hierarchical approach means Active Inference agents can:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Adapt to genuine changes</strong> (water tank empty → update "coffee maker ready" belief)</li>
<li><strong>Ignore noise</strong> (weird sensor reading → don't panic)</li>
<li><strong>Preserve core knowledge</strong> (physics doesn't change → don't update that)</li>
<li><strong>Handle novelty intelligently</strong> (unexpected observation → increase uncertainty, gather more data)</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Balance</h2>
<p>You're right that there's a tension here. Too stable = can't adapt. Too plastic = no persistent knowledge.</p>
<p>Active Inference addresses this by making stability a <em>function of evidence</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideas supported by lots of consistent evidence = stable</li>
<li>Ideas supported by little or conflicting evidence = flexible</li>
<li>The system automatically adjusts how much it updates based on its confidence</li>
</ul>
<p>This is actually more sophisticated than many machine learning approaches, which often use fixed learning rates and can suffer from "catastrophic forgetting" when learning new things.</p>
<p>Does this help explain how Active Inference maintains important knowledge while still being adaptive? The key is that it's not <em>equally</em> quick to update everything—it tracks confidence and adjusts learning accordingly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, mostly. But in your coffee maker example, why doesn't Adaptive Inference switch to troubleshooting mode, given it <em>ought</em> to know that machines break or are sometimes just not plugged in? Why fail for nine days before switching? And how would the model know at all that machines break?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, NOW you're getting to the really interesting part! You've identified a crucial limitation in my simplified explanation. Let me clarify what's actually happening.</p>
<h2>The Short Answer</h2>
<p>You're absolutely right—a well-designed Active Inference agent <em>should</em> switch to troubleshooting mode almost immediately! The 9-day example I gave was misleading. Let me explain what would actually happen and how the agent knows about things like "machines break."</p>
<h2>How The Agent Knows About Machine Failures</h2>
<p>Active Inference agents can encode <strong>multiple hypotheses</strong> in their generative model simultaneously. The model doesn't just represent "button → coffee." It represents something richer:</p>
<h3>A More Realistic Model Structure:</h3>
<pre><code>State variables:
- Coffee maker functional: TRUE/FALSE
- Water tank full: TRUE/FALSE  
- Power connected: TRUE/FALSE
- Button pressed: TRUE/FALSE

Causal relationships:
- IF (functional=TRUE AND water=TRUE AND power=TRUE AND button=TRUE) 
  THEN coffee dispenses
- IF (functional=FALSE) THEN button has no effect
- Functional state can transition from TRUE→FALSE over time
- Functional state can be tested by checking power, water, etc.
```

**Where does this structure come from?**

1. **Engineered priors**: Designers can build in knowledge that "systems have components that can fail independently"
2. **Transfer learning**: If the agent learned about other machines, it knows machines can break
3. **Past experience**: If this coffee maker has broken before, that's in the model
4. **Hierarchical abstraction**: Higher levels encode general principles like "tools sometimes stop working"

## What Actually Happens on Day 501

When the button doesn't work, the agent doesn't just slowly update "buttons don't work." Instead:

**The agent infers hidden states** using all its hypotheses:
```
Observation: Button pressed, no coffee
Possible explanations (posterior probabilities):
- P(water empty | observation) = 0.4
- P(not plugged in | observation) = 0.3  
- P(machine broken | observation) = 0.2
- P(sensor malfunction | observation) = 0.08
- P(I misperceived | observation) = 0.02
```

This is **Bayesian inference over hidden states**—the agent is computing "which hidden state of the world best explains what I'm seeing?"

## Active Troubleshooting

Here's where Active Inference gets powerful: The agent doesn't just passively update beliefs. It **selects actions to reduce uncertainty**.

This is called **active learning** or **information-seeking behavior**:

**Step 1: Predict information gain**
"If water is empty, checking the tank will be very informative. If I'm just misperceiving, checking won't help. Let me calculate expected information gain for each possible action."

**Step 2: Choose informative actions**
The agent is driven to minimize uncertainty about important variables. So it might:
- Check water level (high info gain, disambiguates water vs. power vs. broken)
- Check if it's plugged in (high info gain)
- Try pressing button again (low info gain—already did this)

**Step 3: Update based on results**
- Checks water → Full!
- Updates: P(water empty) → 0.0, redistributes probability to other hypotheses
- Checks power → Unplugged!
- Updates: P(not plugged in) → 0.95

This is "troubleshooting mode"—it emerges naturally from the drive to minimize uncertainty about hidden states.

## The Precision-Weighted Update Revisited

My earlier example was too simplistic. What actually happens with precision weighting:

**If button fails once:**
- High uncertainty about *why* it failed
- Agent's model includes multiple possible causes
- Agent seeks information to disambiguate
- Doesn't strongly commit to any single explanation until evidence accumulates

**If button fails consistently AND agent checks everything else:**
- Water full: ✓
- Plugged in: ✓
- Button mechanically working: ✓
- Still no coffee after 10 tries: ...then conclude "deeper malfunction"

The precision weighting doesn't prevent troubleshooting—it prevents *premature commitment* to explanations before gathering enough evidence.

## Why My Example Was Misleading

I said it takes until day 510 to update beliefs, but that's only if the agent:
1. Doesn't have "malfunction" as a hypothesis in its model (bad design!)
2. Doesn't actively investigate (ignoring information-seeking drives)
3. Just keeps pressing the button without checking anything else (not minimizing uncertainty)

A well-designed Active Inference agent would investigate on day 501 because **the prediction error itself is informative** and drives exploration.

## The Deeper Question: Model Structure

You've identified something really important: **The agent's behavior depends entirely on what's in its generative model.**

If the model only represents:
```
button → coffee (sometimes works, sometimes doesn't)
```

Then it can't troubleshoot. It just updates probabilities about button reliability.

If the model represents:
```
(button AND power AND water AND functional_state) → coffee
</code></pre>
<p>Then it <em>can</em> troubleshoot by inferring hidden states and testing them.</p>
<p><strong>This is a fundamental challenge</strong>: Active Inference doesn't magically know about power plugs and water tanks. That structure must come from:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Innate priors</strong> (engineered or evolved)</h3>
<p>"Objects have parts. Parts can fail. Effects have multiple necessary conditions."</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Learning compositional structure</strong></h3>
<p>Through experience, discover that "coffee-making" decomposes into subprocesses that can fail independently. This requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiencing various failure modes</li>
<li>Noticing patterns (when X fails, checking Y often helps)</li>
<li>Building hierarchical causal models</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Language/communication</strong> (in hybrid systems)</h3>
<p>This is where LLMs could help! An LLM could provide the structure: "Coffee makers require: power, water, functional heating element, functional pump..."</p>
<p>The Active Inference agent then grounds this abstract knowledge through actual interaction.</p>
<h2>An Analogy: You and Your Car</h2>
<p>When your car won't start, you don't conclude "cars don't start anymore." You have a rich causal model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery dead?</li>
<li>Out of gas?</li>
<li>Engine problem?</li>
<li>Key fob battery?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where did this model come from?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some innate (you understand objects have parts)</li>
<li>Some learned (you've seen cars fail before)</li>
<li>Some taught (someone explained how cars work)</li>
<li>Some reasoned (you eliminated possibilities through testing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Active Inference agents need similar model-building processes. The troubleshooting emerges from having the right causal structure, not from being "quick to update."</p>
<h2>The Real Innovation</h2>
<p>What makes Active Inference powerful for troubleshooting isn't rapid belief updating—it's:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Explicit uncertainty representation</strong>: Knows what it doesn't know</li>
<li><strong>Information-seeking drives</strong>: Motivated to resolve uncertainty</li>
<li><strong>Counterfactual simulation</strong>: Can mentally test "what if water is empty?"</li>
<li><strong>Causal structure</strong>: Understands components and their relationships</li>
</ol>
<p>This is very different from LLMs, which might <em>describe</em> troubleshooting steps (having read service manuals) but can't actually infer hidden states from observations or decide which tests would be most informative.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>You're absolutely right to push back on my example. A proper Active Inference agent wouldn't wait 9 days—it would immediately:</p>
<ol>
<li>Register high uncertainty about cause</li>
<li>Be driven to reduce that uncertainty</li>
<li>Select diagnostic actions</li>
<li>Update beliefs based on findings</li>
</ol>
<p>The key limitation is: it can only troubleshoot within the causal structure it has. If "machines break" isn't in the model, it can't troubleshoot machine failures. This is why hybrid architectures with LLMs (providing rich structural knowledge) and Active Inference (grounding it through interaction) are so promising.</p>
<p>Does this clarify how troubleshooting would actually work?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two problems for me. First, the Model Structure you showed looks suspiciously like what one would feed an Expert System, and I know Active Inference isn't an expert system. And second, without having the system digest a manual first, or have "experienced" all the possibilities? Can you tell I'm skeptical about Active Inference?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ha! Yes, I can tell you're skeptical—and you're asking exactly the right questions. You've nailed two genuine problems with how I've been explaining this. Let me be more honest about what's actually going on.</p>
<h2>Problem 1: Yes, That Looked Like An Expert System</h2>
<p>You're right to call this out. What I showed you—those IF-THEN rules—is NOT how Active Inference actually represents things. I oversimplified to make it intuitive, but I made it look like symbolic AI from the 1980s.</p>
<p><strong>What Active Inference actually uses:</strong></p>
<p>It represents the world as <strong>probability distributions over continuous or discrete variables</strong>, not logical rules. The math looks more like:</p>
<pre><code>P(observation | hidden_state, action) - likelihood function
P(hidden_state) - prior beliefs about the world
P(action | hidden_state) - policy (what to do given beliefs)
</code></pre>
<p>These are <strong>learned statistical relationships</strong>, not hand-coded rules. For example:</p>
<p>Instead of: <code>IF plugged_in=TRUE THEN coffee_works</code></p>
<p>It learns: <code>P(coffee_dispenses | plugged_in, other_factors)</code> - a probability distribution shaped by experience.</p>
<p>The agent learns these probability distributions through interaction, using techniques like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variational inference</li>
<li>Gradient descent on prediction errors</li>
<li>Structure learning algorithms (discovering which variables influence which)</li>
</ul>
<p>So it's not brittle rule-based reasoning—it's probabilistic inference over learned models.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong> (and this is important): The agent still needs to have the right <strong>variables</strong> in its state space. It can learn the relationships between them, but discovering what variables even matter? That's genuinely hard.</p>
<h2>Problem 2: The "Experiencing All Possibilities" Problem</h2>
<p>This is where your skepticism is completely justified. Here's the uncomfortable truth:</p>
<p><strong>Active Inference systems, as currently implemented, have a serious scalability problem.</strong></p>
<p>Let me break down what they can and can't do:</p>
<h3>What Current Active Inference Can Handle:</h3>
<p><strong>Relatively constrained domains:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Robot navigation in a room (states: position, obstacle locations)</li>
<li>Game playing (states: game board, pieces, rules)</li>
<li>Simple control tasks (states: joint angles, velocities)</li>
<li>Sensorimotor coordination (states: body position, sensory inputs)</li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases, the agent can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a simple prior structure</li>
<li>Explore the space systematically</li>
<li>Learn the causal relationships through repeated interactions</li>
<li>Generalize within that domain</li>
</ul>
<h3>What It Currently Struggles With:</h3>
<p><strong>Open-ended, complex domains like "understanding coffee makers in general":</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Too many possible variables (power, water, coffee grounds, temperature, pump pressure, heating element, timer circuit, mineral buildup...)</li>
<li>Too many possible failure modes</li>
<li>Takes enormous amounts of interaction to discover structure</li>
<li>No efficient way to learn abstract concepts like "machines" or "electrical appliances"</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Honest State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Here's what researchers are actually working with:</p>
<p><strong>1. Hand-crafted structure for complex tasks</strong></p>
<p>For anything complicated (like diagnosing a coffee maker), current Active Inference implementations DO require humans to specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the relevant state variables are</li>
<li>The basic factorization of the model (which variables influence which)</li>
<li>Reasonable prior distributions</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the agent learns the <em>parameters</em> (specific probabilities) through experience, but not the <em>structure</em> (what variables exist and matter).</p>
<p>This is less like learning from scratch and more like: "Here's a template for reasoning about coffee makers. Now go learn the specifics through interaction."</p>
<p><strong>2. Structure learning is a frontier research problem</strong></p>
<p>There's active work on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bayesian structure learning</strong>: Algorithms that discover which variables are causally related</li>
<li><strong>Compositional models</strong>: Learning reusable components (like "button," "pump," "heating element") that can be recombined</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical learning</strong>: Discovering abstraction layers (specific machine → machines in general → tools → artifacts)</li>
</ul>
<p>But this is HARD and mostly works in toy domains. Nothing close to human-like open-ended structure learning.</p>
<p><strong>3. Transfer learning is limited</strong></p>
<p>If an Active Inference agent learns about one coffee maker, it can transfer some knowledge to similar coffee makers. But transferring from "coffee makers" to "toasters" to "all electrical appliances"? That level of abstraction is not something current Active Inference does well.</p>
<h2>Where This Leaves Us</h2>
<p>Your skepticism is warranted. Current Active Inference systems are not magical learning machines that figure out how the world works from scratch. They're more like:</p>
<p><strong>Good at:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptive control and planning in domains with well-defined state spaces</li>
<li>Learning causal relationships through active experimentation</li>
<li>Handling uncertainty and partial observability</li>
<li>Sample-efficient learning <em>within</em> a properly specified model structure</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Not good at:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open-ended conceptual learning</li>
<li>Discovering what variables matter in the first place</li>
<li>Learning from limited, passive observation (like reading manuals)</li>
<li>Abstract reasoning about novel domains</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why The LLM Hybrid Makes So Much Sense</h2>
<p>This is actually why people are excited about combining Active Inference with LLMs:</p>
<p><strong>LLM contributes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rich conceptual structure learned from text ("coffee makers have these components, which can fail in these ways...")</li>
<li>Abstract knowledge about categories, causal relationships, troubleshooting strategies</li>
<li>The ability to reason about things never directly experienced</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Active Inference contributes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Grounding abstract concepts in actual sensorimotor experience</li>
<li>Adapting general knowledge to specific situations</li>
<li>Learning what works through trial and error</li>
<li>Real-time adaptation when the environment differs from descriptions</li>
</ul>
<p>Without the LLM, the Active Inference agent is stuck learning everything from scratch in the specific domain it's embedded in—which works for robots learning to walk but not for general intelligence.</p>
<p>Without Active Inference, the LLM just regurgitates text patterns about troubleshooting without actually understanding through interaction or being able to adapt its knowledge based on what actually happens.</p>
<h2>The Brutal Honesty</h2>
<p>Active Inference is not currently close to being a general-purpose question-answering system like Claude or ChatGPT because:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It doesn't have language understanding</strong>—it works with sensorimotor states, not linguistic concepts</li>
<li><strong>It doesn't have pre-existing world knowledge</strong>—it learns from scratch through interaction</li>
<li><strong>It doesn't scale to open-ended domains</strong>—it needs constrained state spaces</li>
<li><strong>Structure learning is still a research problem</strong>—it often needs hand-crafted model templates</li>
</ol>
<p>What it IS good at is being an adaptive agent in specific domains where it can interact, experiment, and learn causal relationships. It's complementary to LLMs, not a replacement.</p>
<h2>Should You Still Be Interested?</h2>
<p>Despite these limitations, Active Inference is interesting because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides a principled framework for embodied, goal-directed agents</li>
<li>It handles uncertainty and active learning elegantly</li>
<li>It's based on solid theoretical foundations (free energy principle, Bayesian brain hypothesis)</li>
<li>It might be how biological intelligence actually works</li>
<li>Combined with other AI approaches (including LLMs), it could enable more robust, adaptable systems</li>
</ul>
<p>But anyone claiming Active Inference is about to replace LLMs for general question-answering is overselling it. The research is nowhere near that.</p>
<p>Does this more honest assessment address your skepticism? You're right to be skeptical of oversimplified explanations—the reality is messier and more limited than I initially made it sound.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, that was much, much better. Are there any "extra honest" wrinkles you haven't mentioned yet that I might like to know about?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ha! I appreciate you pushing for the full picture. Yes, there are several more "uncomfortable truths" about Active Inference that don't make it into the glossy explanations:</p>
<h2>1. <strong>The Computational Intractability Problem</strong></h2>
<p>Active Inference requires computing probability distributions over all possible states and all possible action sequences. This is mathematically elegant but computationally nightmarish.</p>
<p><strong>The issue:</strong> Exact inference is intractable for anything but tiny state spaces. So in practice, researchers use approximations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variational inference (approximate the true posterior with a simpler distribution)</li>
<li>Sampling methods (Monte Carlo approximations)</li>
<li>Mean-field approximations (assume independence between variables that aren't actually independent)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What this means:</strong> The agent isn't actually doing "pure" Active Inference. It's doing a computationally feasible approximation that might miss important dependencies or make systematic errors. The gap between the beautiful theory and the implemented algorithms is significant.</p>
<h2>2. <strong>The "Credit Assignment" Problem</strong></h2>
<p>When something goes wrong (or right), how does the agent know which part of its model to update?</p>
<p>If the coffee doesn't dispense, is it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The motor control policy?</li>
<li>The model of how buttons work?</li>
<li>The model of coffee maker state transitions?</li>
<li>Sensory uncertainty parameters?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In deep hierarchical models</strong>, credit assignment becomes really hard. The agent might update the wrong parts of its model, leading to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slow learning</li>
<li>Weird compensatory behaviors</li>
<li>Getting stuck in local optima</li>
</ul>
<p>This is especially problematic when the model has hundreds or thousands of parameters.</p>
<h2>3. <strong>The Goal Specification Problem</strong></h2>
<p>Active Inference agents minimize "surprise" relative to their <strong>preferred observations</strong> (goals). But where do these preferences come from?</p>
<p><strong>In practice:</strong> Researchers hand-specify them. "The agent prefers to be at the goal location" or "The agent prefers observations consistent with having coffee."</p>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> This is essentially hard-coding what the agent should want. There's no good theory yet for:</p>
<ul>
<li>How preferences should be learned</li>
<li>How to specify complex, context-dependent goals</li>
<li>How to handle conflicting preferences</li>
<li>How to avoid reward hacking (agent finds weird ways to achieve technically-correct but not-actually-desired outcomes)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is basically the same "alignment problem" that plagues reinforcement learning, just dressed in different mathematical clothes.</p>
<h2>4. <strong>The "Model Selection" Problem</strong></h2>
<p>I mentioned the agent maintains multiple hypotheses. But how many? Which ones?</p>
<p><strong>The reality:</strong> There are infinitely many possible models that could explain any given data. The agent can't consider them all. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Researchers pre-select a hypothesis space (a limited set of possible models)</li>
<li>Model comparison is computationally expensive</li>
<li>The agent might never consider the "right" model if it's not in the pre-specified space</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you only give the agent models that involve "water" and "power," it will never discover that mineral buildup can clog the mechanism. The hypothesis space constrains what can be learned.</p>
<h2>5. <strong>The "Reality Gap"</strong></h2>
<p>Most impressive Active Inference results are in <strong>simulation</strong>. When you move to the real world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensors are noisy in ways the model doesn't capture</li>
<li>Actuators are imprecise</li>
<li>The environment has complexities not in the model</li>
<li>Real-time computation constraints matter</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transfer from simulation to reality</strong> is a huge challenge. Many systems that work beautifully in simulated environments fail or require extensive tuning when deployed on real robots.</p>
<h2>6. <strong>The Empirical Track Record Is... Mixed</strong></h2>
<p>Let me be blunt: Active Inference has not (yet) produced many practical applications that outperform other methods significantly.</p>
<p><strong>Where it has shown promise:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some robotics applications (especially sensorimotor control)</li>
<li>Certain neuroscience modeling applications</li>
<li>Academic benchmarks in specific domains</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where it hasn't dominated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It hasn't replaced reinforcement learning for most control tasks</li>
<li>It hasn't replaced SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for robot navigation</li>
<li>It hasn't produced breakthrough applications in industry</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computational complexity</li>
<li>Need for careful model design</li>
<li>Competition with well-established methods</li>
<li>Small research community (compared to deep learning)</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. <strong>The "Free Energy Principle" Might Be Unfalsifiable</strong></h2>
<p>Active Inference is derived from the <strong>Free Energy Principle</strong> (FEP)—a theoretical framework claiming that all self-organizing systems minimize free energy.</p>
<p><strong>The controversy:</strong> Some critics argue the FEP is so general it's unfalsifiable:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be made to explain almost any behavior post-hoc</li>
<li>It's unclear what would count as evidence <em>against</em> it</li>
<li>The connection between the abstract principle and concrete algorithms is sometimes hand-wavy</li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn't mean it's <em>wrong</em>, but it means the theoretical foundations are more controversial than proponents sometimes suggest.</p>
<h2>8. <strong>The Sample Efficiency Claim Needs Context</strong></h2>
<p>You saw the claim: "99.8% accuracy with 10% of the data!"</p>
<p><strong>Important context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is on specific benchmarks where the model structure is well-suited to the task</li>
<li>It's comparing to methods that might not be optimized for that particular problem</li>
<li>It doesn't generalize to "Active Inference is always 10x more sample efficient"</li>
<li>In many domains, deep learning can be more sample efficient (especially when you can use pre-training, transfer learning, or data augmentation)</li>
</ul>
<p>The sample efficiency advantage is real <em>in some circumstances</em>, but not universal.</p>
<h2>9. <strong>The "Understanding" Question</strong></h2>
<p>Does Active Inference really "understand" causation, or is it just learning predictive correlations with extra steps?</p>
<p><strong>The debate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proponents say: It learns generative models that capture causal structure, enabling counterfactual reasoning</li>
<li>Skeptics say: It's still fundamentally learning correlations from data, just with a fancier probabilistic framework</li>
<li>The truth: Depends on model structure. If you build in the right causal assumptions, it can reason causally. If you don't, it might just learn correlations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The uncomfortable part:</strong> The "causal reasoning" often relies on assumptions engineered into the model, not discovered by the agent.</p>
<h2>10. <strong>The Hype Cycle</strong></h2>
<p>Like many AI approaches, Active Inference has its evangelists who oversell it:</p>
<ul>
<li>"It's how the brain really works!" (debatable, oversimplified)</li>
<li>"It solves the alignment problem!" (no, it just restates it)</li>
<li>"It's the path to AGI!" (unproven, speculative)</li>
<li>"It's fundamentally different from other AI!" (yes and no—shares many limitations)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The reality:</strong> It's a promising framework with some interesting properties, genuine limitations, and a lot of open research questions. It's not a silver bullet.</p>
<h2>11. <strong>The Integration Challenge</strong></h2>
<p>Even if you wanted to build a hybrid LLM + Active Inference system:</p>
<p><strong>Nobody really knows how to do this well yet.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How do you translate between linguistic representations and probabilistic state spaces?</li>
<li>How do you handle the different timescales (LLM inference is fast, Active Inference learning is slow)?</li>
<li>How do you maintain consistency between the LLM's "knowledge" and the Active Inference agent's "world model"?</li>
<li>Who's in charge when they disagree?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are open research problems, not solved engineering challenges.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Active Inference is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theoretically elegant</li>
<li>Mathematically principled</li>
<li>Good at some specific things</li>
<li>Computationally expensive</li>
<li>Still mostly in the research phase</li>
<li>Not close to replacing current AI systems for most applications</li>
<li>Promising for certain hybrid architectures (maybe)</li>
<li>Oversold by some advocates</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a legitimate research direction that might contribute to future AI systems, but it's not the revolutionary breakthrough that some marketing materials suggest.</p>
<p><strong>The honest assessment:</strong> It's interesting, it has real advantages in specific domains, it's worth researching further, but anyone claiming it's about to transform AI is getting ahead of the evidence.</p>
<p>Does that give you the full, unvarnished picture? I tried to be as honest as possible about the gaps between theory and practice, the unsolved problems, and the legitimate controversies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That was terrific. Thank you. One last question: don't many of the algorithms inside LLMs also "minimize surprise"? Isn't that what a lot of the learning methods are trying to do? Why is that pitched as novel with Active Inference? (besides that it's done with other algorithms and theories)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Excellent catch.</strong> You've identified something that irritates a lot of people in AI: the rebranding of concepts to make them seem more novel than they are.</p>
<p>You're absolutely right. Let me break down what's really going on.</p>
<h2>Yes, LLMs Minimize Surprise</h2>
<p><strong>What LLMs do during training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Predict the next token given context</li>
<li>Measure "surprise" (cross-entropy loss, which is literally a measure of surprise in information theory)</li>
<li>Update parameters to minimize that surprise</li>
<li>Repeat billions of times</li>
</ul>
<p>This is <strong>explicitly</strong> minimizing prediction error / surprise. The loss function is even called "negative log-likelihood," which is mathematically equivalent to surprise.</p>
<p>So when Active Inference advocates say "our agents minimize surprise," anyone familiar with machine learning should think: "...so does literally every predictive model."</p>
<h2>What's (Supposedly) Different About Active Inference?</h2>
<p>The Active Inference community emphasizes several distinctions, with varying degrees of legitimacy:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Action Selection Based on Minimizing <em>Expected Future</em> Surprise</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The claim:</strong> LLMs minimize surprise over training data (past). Active Inference agents choose actions to minimize surprise over future observations.</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> It's planning. The agent simulates "if I do action A, what will I observe, and how surprised will I be?" and picks actions that lead to unsurprising (predictable, preferred) outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Is this novel?</strong> Not really. This is what <strong>model-based reinforcement learning</strong> does. And optimal control. And planning algorithms. The math is dressed up differently (free energy vs. value functions), but the core idea—"pick actions that lead to good predicted outcomes"—is standard.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Both Perception and Action Minimize the Same Objective</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The claim:</strong> In Active Inference, there's a unified framework where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perception updates beliefs to minimize surprise (inference)</li>
<li>Action changes the world to minimize surprise (control)</li>
<li>Both are minimizing the same "free energy" quantity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this novel?</strong> Kind of. It's an elegant theoretical unification. Most RL frameworks treat perception (state estimation) and control (action selection) as separate problems, even though they're related.</p>
<p><strong>But pragmatically:</strong> When you implement it, you still end up with separate algorithms for inference and control. The "unification" is more philosophical than practical in current implementations.</p>
<h3>3. <strong>Active Data Collection</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The claim:</strong> Active Inference agents don't just passively minimize prediction error on whatever data they see. They actively seek information to reduce uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> The agent explores specifically to improve its model, not just to maximize reward.</p>
<p><strong>Is this novel?</strong> No. This is literally what <strong>active learning</strong>, <strong>curiosity-driven exploration</strong>, and <strong>information-theoretic exploration bonuses</strong> do in RL. These have been around for decades.</p>
<p>The "active" in "Active Inference" sounds distinctive, but information-seeking behavior is well-studied in other frameworks.</p>
<h3>4. <strong>Generative Models vs. Discriminative Models</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The claim:</strong> Active Inference uses generative models (P(observation|state)) while many ML systems use discriminative models (P(state|observation)).</p>
<p><strong>Is this novel?</strong> No. Generative models have been around forever:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hidden Markov Models (1960s)</li>
<li>Kalman filters (1960s)</li>
<li>Bayesian networks (1980s)</li>
<li>Variational autoencoders (2013)</li>
<li>Diffusion models (2020s)</li>
</ul>
<p>LLMs themselves are generative models! They model P(next_token|context), generating text.</p>
<p>The generative vs. discriminative distinction is real and important, but it's not unique to Active Inference.</p>
<h2>The Marketing Problem</h2>
<p>Here's what frustrates people: <strong>Active Inference repackages well-known concepts with new terminology and claims novelty.</strong></p>
<p>Let me translate some common Active Inference phrases into standard ML/AI terminology:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Active Inference Says</th>
<th align="left">Standard AI Says</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">"Minimize variational free energy"</td>
<td align="left">"Maximize evidence lower bound (ELBO)" or "Do approximate Bayesian inference"</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>To be fair:</strong> The Active Inference framework does combine these ideas in a specific mathematical formulation with some elegant properties. But the <em>core concepts</em> aren't new.</p>
<h2>Why The Confusion?</h2>
<p><strong>1. Different research communities use different language</strong></p>
<p>Active Inference comes from <strong>neuroscience and theoretical biology</strong>, trying to explain how brains work. They developed their own terminology independently from the machine learning community.</p>
<p>When they say "minimize surprise," they mean it in the context of the <strong>Free Energy Principle</strong>, which is trying to explain all self-organizing systems, not just build AI.</p>
<p><strong>2. Genuine theoretical differences (maybe)</strong></p>
<p>There are <em>some</em> theoretical differences in:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the objective is formulated mathematically</li>
<li>The philosophical interpretation (e.g., connecting to thermodynamics, information geometry)</li>
<li>The emphasis on biological plausibility</li>
</ul>
<p>But when you implement it on a computer, you often end up with algorithms that look awfully similar to existing methods.</p>
<p><strong>3. Interdisciplinary communication failure</strong></p>
<p>ML researchers often roll their eyes at Active Inference because it seems like old wine in new bottles.</p>
<p>Active Inference researchers get defensive because they feel ML people don't understand the theoretical nuances.</p>
<p>Both sides have valid points, but the communication gap leads to overselling and skepticism.</p>
<h2>The Honest Answer To Your Question</h2>
<p><strong>"Why is minimizing surprise pitched as novel?"</strong></p>
<p>Because:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It sounds profound</strong> when framed as a universal principle rather than a practical algorithm</li>
<li><strong>Marketing</strong> - every research community needs to differentiate itself to get funding and attention</li>
<li><strong>Genuine belief</strong> by some researchers that the theoretical framework is fundamentally different (even if implementations converge)</li>
<li><strong>Different emphasis</strong> - Active Inference emphasizes biological plausibility and theoretical elegance over practical performance</li>
<li><strong>Disciplinary silos</strong> - neuroscientists "discovering" things that ML already knew, and vice versa</li>

<h2>What IS Somewhat Distinctive About Active Inference?</h2>
<p>To be fair, there are some aspects that are relatively distinctive (though not entirely unique):</p>
<p><strong>1. The explicit focus on minimizing surprise about preferred observations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most RL: "maximize reward"</li>
<li>Active Inference: "minimize surprise relative to preferred states"</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be mathematically related, but the framing is different and might lead to different algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>2. The principled way of handling uncertainty and exploration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Information-seeking emerges naturally from the framework rather than being added as an exploration bonus</li>
<li>Though pragmatically, implementations often look similar to intrinsic motivation in RL</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. The theoretical unification of perception, action, and learning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even if implementations separate these, the theoretical framework is more unified than most RL formulations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. The connection to neuroscience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If Active Inference is right about how brains work, that's valuable even if it doesn't lead to better AI</li>
<li>Though this claim itself is controversial</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>You're right to be skeptical of the "novelty" claims. Minimizing surprise/prediction error is fundamental to most modern AI. Active Inference packages it differently, adds some theoretical elegance, and makes connections to neuroscience, but it's not a radically new idea.</p>
<p>The legitimate contributions are more about:</p>
<ul>
<li>A particular mathematical formulation that might have some advantages</li>
<li>Connections to biological intelligence</li>
<li>A framework that naturally incorporates active learning and exploration</li>
</ul>
<p>But anyone claiming "Active Inference is revolutionary because it minimizes surprise, unlike other AI" is either ignorant of existing ML methods or being deliberately misleading for marketing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>The nuance:</strong> There might be valuable theoretical insights in how Active Inference formulates things, even if the core concepts aren't new. Sometimes seeing old ideas from a new angle leads to progress. But the hype often outstrips the substance.</p>
<p>Does that address your (very astute) observation? You're asking exactly the questions that need to be asked to cut through the marketing and get to what's actually going on.</p>

<h2>Top Five Critiques of Active Inference/Free Energy Principle</h2>
<h3>1. <strong>Mathematical Errors in the Original Formulation</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Biehl, Felix A. Pollock, and Ryota Kanai<br />
<strong>Paper:</strong> "A Technical Critique of Some Parts of the Free Energy Principle" (2021)<br />
<strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06408">https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06408</a></p>
<p>This paper proves by counterexamples that the original free energy lemma is mathematically wrong when taken at face value, and shows that crucial steps involving Markov blankets are not generally correct without additional unstated assumptions <a href="https://medium.com/aimonks/the-ultimate-resource-guide-for-active-inference-ai-2024-q1-04e361d0c993">Medium</a><a href="https://deniseholt.us/the-ultimate-resource-guide-for-active-inference-ai-2024-q1/">Spatial Web AI</a>. The authors reveal that various definitions of "Markov blanket" proposed in different works are not equivalent, and conclude that the Bayesian inference interpretation is not sufficiently justified <a href="https://medium.com/aimonks/the-ultimate-resource-guide-for-active-inference-ai-2024-q1-04e361d0c993">Medium</a>.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>The "Markov Blanket Trick" - Not a General Principle</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vicente Raja, Dinesh Valluri, Edward Baggs, Anthony Chemero, and Michael L. Anderson<br />
<strong>Paper:</strong> "The Markov blanket trick: On the scope of the free energy principle and active inference" (2021)<br />
<strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1571064521000634">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1571064521000634</a></p>
<p>These authors argue that FEP is just a way to generalize Bayesian inference to all domains using Markov blanket formalism (what they call the "Markov blanket trick"), and that active inference presupposes successful perception and action instead of explaining them <a href="https://www.verses.ai/genius">Genius</a><a href="https://www.verses.ai/active-inference-research">Genius</a>. They contend that FEP is better understood as a modeling framework rather than a principle for a theory of everything <a href="https://www.verses.ai/active-inference-research">Genius</a>.</p>
<h3>3. <strong>Unfalsifiability and Lack of Empirical Content</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Mel Andrews<br />
<strong>Paper:</strong> "The Math is not the Territory: Navigating the Free Energy Principle" (2021)<br />
<strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://philarchive.org/rec/ANDTMI-2">https://philarchive.org/rec/ANDTMI-2</a></p>
<p>Andrews argues that demands for the FEP to be falsifiable or conform to biological realism rest on a category error, proposing instead that FEP should be understood as a model structure rather than an empirical theory <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7997279/">PubMed Central</a>. Andrews contends the principle is not truth-apt because as a set of mathematical tools it does not by itself entail any empirical claims <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/2/238">MDPI</a>.</p>
<h3>4. <strong>Biological Systems Require Biological, Not Physical Principles</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Wolfgang Stegemann<br />
<strong>Paper:</strong> "Criticisms of the theory of free energy or the 'Bayesian brain' by Karl Friston" (2024)<br />
<strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://medium.com/neo-cybernetics/criticisms-of-the-theory-of-free-energy-or-the-bayesian-brain-by-karl-friston-52749b92c9d3">https://medium.com/neo-cybernetics/criticisms-of-the-theory-of-free-energy-or-the-bayesian-brain-by-karl-friston-52749b92c9d3</a></p>
<p>This critique argues that the theory represents a reversal of causality—minimization of uncertainty is a consequence of actions, not their primary intention, and that organisms evolve to survive and reproduce, not to minimize free energy <a href="https://diginomica.com/cce-2024-active-inference-ai-shakes-enterprise-ai-conversation-edgier-thinking-whats-next">Diginomica</a>. Stegemann contends that Bayesian formalism and free energy alone are insufficient to explain brain functioning, and that the brain should be understood through biological principles rather than mathematical ones <a href="https://diginomica.com/cce-2024-active-inference-ai-shakes-enterprise-ai-conversation-edgier-thinking-whats-next">Diginomica</a>.</p>
<h3>5. <strong>Philosophical and Organicist Critiques</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Various (summarized in Ramstead et al.'s target article responses)<br />
<strong>Paper:</strong> "The Free Energy Principle: Good Science and Questionable Philosophy in a Grand Unifying Theory" (2021)<br />
<strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/2/238">https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/2/238</a></p>
<p>Organicist critics argue that if historical considerations and lineage matter to understanding organisms, then biological systems should be represented as 'specific' with their trajectories as 'generic,' but free-energy theorists get it backward <a href="https://web3.arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/2024-06?skip=850&amp;show=100">Arxiv</a><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661323002607">ScienceDirect</a>. They heavily criticize the FEP's crucial assumption about ergodicity over the system's lifespan, which might lead to insufficient characterizations of organisms' phenotypes, and question whether free energy, surprise, and optimization exist as biological properties in complex adaptive systems <a href="https://web3.arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/2024-06?skip=850&amp;show=100">Arxiv</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>These five critiques cover the major objections: mathematical rigor problems, scope limitations, unfalsifiability concerns, biological inappropriateness, and philosophical issues with the framework's foundational assumptions.</p>
