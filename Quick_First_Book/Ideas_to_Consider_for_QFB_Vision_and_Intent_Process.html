      <h1>Ideas to Consider for QFB Vision and Intent Process</h1>
<p>Read each numbered item as starting with "The QFB Project should...", and then consider if your opinion is <strong>strongly agree, agree, no opinion, disagree, strongly disagree.</strong> <em>(See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale">Likert scale - Wikipedia</a>.)</em></p>
<p>To make it easy to remember your answers (especially for <strong>strongly agree</strong> items), consider printing this page and annotating with a pen, or copy and paste this page into a document you can mark up.</p>
<p>How would we incorporate your "strongly agree" items into <strong>QFB Vision and Intent</strong>?</p>
<p>Should any of your "strongly disagree" items be referenced in <strong>QFB Vision and Intent</strong> as things to avoid or to push against in the world?</p>
<p>Consider bringing your reactions and any other ideas that come to mind, to the Vision and Intent meeting. Thank you!</p>
