# Ideas to Consider for QFB Vision and Intent Process

Read each numbered item as starting with "The QFB Project should...", and then consider if your opinion is **strongly agree, agree, no opinion, disagree, strongly disagree.** _(See [Likert scale - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale).)_

To make it easy to remember your answers (especially for **strongly agree** items), consider printing this page and annotating with a pen, or copy and paste this page into a document you can mark up.

How would we incorporate your "strongly agree" items into **QFB Vision and Intent**?

Should any of your "strongly disagree" items be referenced in **QFB Vision and Intent** as things to avoid or to push against in the world?

Consider bringing your reactions and any other ideas that come to mind, to the Vision and Intent meeting. Thank you!
