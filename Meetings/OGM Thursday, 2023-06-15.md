The chat was active today, and following below is a curated selection of the concepts, books, and links from just the Zoom chat. Jerry's Brain will have a link to the video and the machine-generated transcript and chat.

The Concepts, Books, and Links sections were prepared by [[Peter Kaminski]] with a combination of hand work and ChatGPT 4. I have provisionally checked it all, and believe it is generally trustworthy, but it's possible that one of the passes through ChatGPT has mangled or misformed some or all of an item, so caveat lector. -- Pete, 2023-06-15
