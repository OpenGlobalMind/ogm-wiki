# Redesigning the Thursday calls, 2021-04-02

## Meta-Agenda

- do we need to continue this discussion?
    - what / how / when

## Notes

- After-Action Review
- For Jerry
    - dipping the ladle in the stream
    - stirring the pot (a little)
    - explicitly won't get to everything
- Debrief Pete on what's not working :)
    - Didn't hear from everyone
    - People who want to chime in don't get to
    - This won't scale
- Whether / How
- Pete: "Federating" calls
- Poll attendees? people who come, people who
 have stopped coming
- Diversity and Inclusion
- Infrastructure for Gathering(s)
    - zoom + mattermost + wiki + forum
    - one on ones
    - trying to do everything
    - 
- How to invite people
- Onboarding
    - Michael: Is the Thursday meeting the onboarding for new participants, or do we want to make something else be that? (ie create a new meeting/s that are the gateway drug)
- How do new people know how these meetings go?
    - feature/bug, emergence is nice, confusion is frustrating
    - tiny bit of risk
- Hand signals

## What is Working / What is Not Working

- "church sense", drink in the goodness of whatever gets said
    - not breaking this seems important
    - a time to commune with each other
    - manifestion of the spirit of OGM
- The calls aren't "open" enough
- Some people feel like they can't participate / aren't welcome in the call
- Time zone friendlyness
- Work day / business hour friendlyness

## The OGM Salon
- guide(s) for how to get the most out of the calls
- guide(s) how to particpate best in the calls

## AA
- structure / template
- every meeting feels like an AA meeting
- your AA meeting feels like home

## Clubhouse
- always-on, perpetual meeting

## Hopin

## What to do now
- Create Massive pages that: 
    - sets Thursday call expectations
    - describe what is where in OGM
    - describe "onboarding" or outreach
    - point to Code of Conduct we like and obey
- Talk on Tuesday 4/6 Opening OGM call about the role of calls in onboarding people

## Action Items
- launch the quest of Opening OGM
    - Tuesday 4/6 Opening OGM call
    - mattermost channel: [[Quest] Opening up OGM](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/quest-opening-up-ogm)
- create a simple set of guideposts for people who are new to the call
    - artifact(s): a simple document people can look at, PDF and web page
- poll participants of Thursday calls
- crowdsource howtos / advice about new calls at the front of the call
    - could be in chat
