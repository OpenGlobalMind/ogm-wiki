How do the Pachinko balls fall? (our usual focus) vs. How did you design the game?

## Weaving The World Seeking Project Manager / Virtual Assistant

Hi, it's Jerry.

I've got a new podcast coming up called "Weaving the World", which is about (what?).

I'm looking for a smart and thoughtful person to help with with doing the operations side of WtW - things like looking for hosting services for the podcast, helping me schedule and book guests, keeping track of all the little tasks that will need to get done.

I expect to need some around 4 hours per week.  We're funded to do a fixed number of episodes.  The whole gig will likely last 3-4 months, but I'm already looking for funding for follow-on seasons.

Is this you or someone you might know?  Please ping me at sociate@gmail.com with leads or questions.  Thanks!
