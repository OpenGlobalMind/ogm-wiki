## Comments

The model of Collective Intelligence by [[Simon Buckingham Shum]] includes: Collective Sensing, Collective Sensemaking, Collective Ideation, Collective Decision, Collective Action. So not just sensemaking.

DSRP is not prescriptive as how to hands-on do systems thinking.   It is about, as Derek says "the thinking behind the thinking".  Think in terms of DSRP, and the result is a good Data Flow Diagram.
