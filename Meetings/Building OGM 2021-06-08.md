### Food Systems Realignment

- FSR needs help, including project management and mappers
- How might we help?

Some of the FSR work we've identified:

> Narrow our focus to develop a mapping tool that identifies community level resources, then stimulates on the ground efforts to connect them to create a functioning system. 
> 
> Connections are from farm to aggregator, logistics services, processing, wholesaling, retailing, direct to consumer sales. An important role will be the innovations broker, whose function is to connect supply to demand and vice versa, providing information and market intelligence to all participants.
> 
> In the interview process we will identify gaps in resources and make recommendations to look at available national level support functions, i.e. double your food buck and other such programs. 
> 
> These are all generic functions that apply to any food service, anywhere in the world, no matter what type of crops or foods or menus being used. We could position this as a prototype project and roll out once we have the tools in place.

### Bootstrap needs for a sovereign

- persistent async messaging (e.g., chat channel, email list)
- document library (e.g., wiki, Notion, Google Docs)
- a good name
- web presence
- charter (mission / vision)
- who we are (at least leadership, and contact info)
- roles we need to fill
- fundraising we've started (here's a endpoint to donate to, here's  what we're trying to fund)

### What are the practical things that we can do to breathe life into OGM and make it more of an entity?
