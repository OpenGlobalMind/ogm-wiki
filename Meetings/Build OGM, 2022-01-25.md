# Build OGM, 2022-01-25

## OGM Video Intros

- light-hearted and social
- an OGM host zooms with them, asks some questions, records video, ~3 minutes or so
- new person gets to choose type of intro
    - light-hearted interview
    - serious, project-oriented

## OGM Mattermost Channel Suggestions

general: start helping mailing list people have discussions on Mattermost in addition to the mailing list

- [ogm] Welcome Wagon 
    - use it as a "crew" channel?
    - decommission it, and invite newbies directly to the general discussion?
    - rename to "Welcome" or other more accesible name? 
- [ogm] Calls
    - should this be renamed to "general discussion" or similar? or should there be a separate "general discussion" channel? (Thought: rename current "Calls" as "General Discussion" because our history lives there, create new "Calls"-only channel, if folks want)
- [ogm] Happy Hour
    - let's create this!
    - how to explain it, who starts it, etc.
- [ogm] Money?
- [ogm] 'Civil War'?
- [ogm] Introductions?


## CSC Mattermost

- how to have an "Information Booth" (i) for new people to CSC Mattermost? (with eye to functioning whether staffed or not)
- (how) should OGM help CSC welcome new people?
