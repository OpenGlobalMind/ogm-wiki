# OGM Thursday, 2021-03-25

notes by [[@Peter Kaminski]]


## Topics
- collective intelligence
    - Klaus: vs. consciuousness ([[Jan Smuts]])

## Pete's Reflections on Using Mmhmm for Call
- was hampered by sharing one window instead whole screen (didn't want zoom video feedback, so didn't share whole screen)
- hackmd on one page is nice, but doesn't show other wiki pages
- it made raising hand and doing jazz hands more challenging
- i had to turn off video mirroring, which i low-key don't like :-)
- on my computer at least, it looks like there is a small video lag for my picture
- not sure how good the resolution of the screenshare was

- droping the word "nature" (natural resources, natural capital)
    - (from pete, tweet about dropping the word "women's" from sports, or having to add "men's", either way)

## Stuff to Look Up

- (pete) saw a twitter thread about "intelligence" in humans, that it's fractal and includes your whole body, not just your brain.
