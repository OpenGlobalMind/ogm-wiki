## OGM Wiki Topics

- using Massive Wiki
- OGM Wiki Ambassadors
- "molting"

## Observations / Rubrics

"good enough to use, safe enough to try"

## Next Steps

- Define each communication channel's mission and functions.
- Decide how to "fund" the work needed for each communication channel's overhead.
- Create roadmap for overhead work on all the communication channels.

## OGM Communication Channels

- OGM mailing list
    - make announce-only
- OGM Forum
- CSC Mattermost
- Zoom calls
    - YouTube recordings
    - OGM Wiki meeting notes and supporting info
- OGM Wiki

The "synchronous - asynchronous" spectrum
- chat, email, forum, wiki

"Channelizing" communications - "surface area" for holding simultaneous thread

"Management" / overhead questions
- Prioritizing where to put management calories?
- Divide management energy?

From membership-at-large questions?
- Which channel(s) is/are "primary"?
- Which channel does what?
- Why are there so many channels, and can I just work in one or two?

## Overhead needed for any communication channel to be really effective

- onboarding / troubleshooting / hand-holding
- information architecture
- collaborations patterns
- problem recognition and resolution

## Overhead needed for a working group to be really effective

- project plan
- project management
- scribe / knowledge weaver
    - apprentice scribe?
- memory
- (all the stuff from the "sovereign structure" list, actually)

It seems like things like project management and knowledge weavers are specialist skills and most people from a working group won't end up doing those roles.  So therefore, we need to "hire" specialists into this, build apprenticeships, etc.

## OGM Forum

- move to Factr?

## OGM Wiki Ambassadors

- reach out to specific people
- come to shared vision for the wiki
- decide on use cases for the community
- do some re-organization / vitalization of the structure
