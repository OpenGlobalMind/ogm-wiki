## Concerns

- framing it in the way we've been framing it may tend to siloization
- growth as a goal
- capital as a framework
- competition, and winners vs. losers
- game plans for ag, etc.
- entrapment / impotence of NGOs
    - compromising values
    - NGOs are businesses
        - business models based on fear
        - clients are capitalist businesses
- money needs to be involved to fix things
- markets
    - too conservative for the amount of organization we need to muster (needs to be Marshall Plan level)
    - "innovation" is sort of stuck in market ideology

## Various Efforts

- Business Climate Leaders
- [Citizen Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/)
- Sierra Club
- Sunrise Movement
- Gaia Fest
- carbon sequestration
- ecosystem services
    - soil
- "innovations broker" (matchmaker between supply and demand)
- energy systems
    - only helps so much; degradation of ecosystem is the keystone
- regenerative
- food sovereignty on a local basis

## OGM working with "Clients"

- in service of clients' interests
- without implication of money at this time

## Zoom chat
