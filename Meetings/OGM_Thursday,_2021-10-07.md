Pete Kaminski

> @Gil, i don't disagree, but unless we are doing it ourselves in the first place, we are just being lazy and (i think) irresponsible in not doing it ourselves and getting better at it, together.  it's like kids playing in the living room, and expecting mom to pick up after them.

Mark Carranza

> the larger tribe of outrage

Stacey Druss

> The right has also invested heavily in employing journalists and amplifying messages.

Jerry Michalski

> so Gil, you’ve been exploring the collaborative book space, right? can we help expand/do that?

Stacey Druss

Gil Philip Friend

> churnalists

Gil Philip Friend

> is there a way to have the benefits of robocuration (feeding me things that it ‘knows’ i’d be interested, plus occasional random gifts) without the narrowing, rage-generating effects we see now?

[[Julian Gómez]]

> One thing is that you’d need to remove the profit motive behind the robocuration.

Pete Kaminski

> @Gil, Google is doing that pretty well for my on my Pixel phone

> And not as well, but still interesting, ThreadHelper (Chrome plugin) is trying to do serendipity on Twitter: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threadhelper/nfadnflafdfmekapgcgddbccooagpndk

Jerry Michalski

> no topsy turvydom?

Pete Kaminski

> here's the Google thing (it helps a lot that it stalks my Google searches):
> "Introducing Google Discover: Discover new information and inspiration with Search, no query required"
> https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-google-discover/
> it produces a lot of boring items, but there are also a few gems, personalized for me.
> (i still prefer my Twitter stream for value and volume, but Google Discover adds a little signal to my life, too.)

[[Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com]]

> @Gil, I’d say that it’s giving YOU hands-on control of your robocurator, based on YOUR incentives (which change: save time vs be entertained, focus vs be distracted), as opposed to the current norm of a 3rd party robocurator with economic interest in maintaining your attention.

Jerry Michalski

> Trillion Tree Campaign: https://bra.in/7joyE5

Pete Kaminski

> btw, a small side element of Neal Stephenson's "Fall; or, Dodge in Hell" is personalized, curated feeds. they cost money (and provide huge value), so rich people have great ones, and not-rich people don't.
> (Reading note, you have to read REAMDE before Fall. You don't have to read Fall, but if you like brain uploading, you might like it.)

Pete Kaminski

Gil Philip Friend

> yes

Pete Kaminski

> they're just ("just") science fiction novels. amazon (pick your poison) or your library would work. I recommend starting with Seven Eves before either of those, or Diamond Age if you remember nanotechnology. I love about half of his books, and meh about the other half. Note that many people find him to write indulgently and overlong, which is either charming or annoying, depending on whether you like it. :-)

> (Neal Stephenson covers some of this territory as well in [In the Beginning Was the Command Line](https://smorgasborg.artlung.com/C_R_Y_P_T_O_N_O_M_I_C_O_N.shtml), particularly in the sections _The Interface Culture_ and _Morlocks and Eloi at the Keyboard_.)

Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com

> Side note: Banana Republic is a weird but amazing example of how brand names become totally malleable nonsense words, ripe for redefinition. Clear descriptive names seem good in the short run, but are straitjackets in the long run.

> Banana Republic might have called themselves the Multi-pocket Adventure Travel-wear Company (which is what they were, and why they chose the name—in a ‘70s ironic band-name way), but they would have hit a dead-end when people stopped wanted to dress like Indian Jones.

> I really want to know what creature took that enormous bite out of Julian’s elephant. If that’s “one bite at a time”, we can make short work of all the imposing elephants in the room.

Gil Philip Friend

> @Pete thank you.

Pete Kaminski

> @Gil, thank you. :-)

Gil Philip Friend

> Re balanced diet: i occasionally learn that when I, for example, exercise before diving into ‘work,’ the work goes better even if it takes place in ‘less available time’

Pete Kaminski

> slow is smooth, smooth is fast

Jerry Michalski

> slowing down. the meta calls. the big fungus. floating ideas, waiting for people to step in and run. Mark and I do this automatically, wherever we participate. dilettantes? sweep the dojo. focus calls. alternate Thursdays?

Gil Philip Friend

> More fundamentallly, I may assume to ‘paying work’ comes from work-seeking activities (ie, sales+marketing), when in fact my best paying work has come from thinking deeply, communicating actively, and letting the flow flow. Thanks for the reminder.

Pete Kaminski

> Agreed. :-)

Gil Philip Friend

> Is there a list of all the calls “we” do? {How many hours/week? ;-)

Pete Kaminski

> probably not an updated one. the Trove calendar is a start

Gil Philip Friend

> @Pete link? (again… :-}

Mark Carranza

> Ha! Pattern language development in MassiveWiki is what I am into right now

Pete Kaminski

> @Gil, https://www.catalist.network/explore-events ; there's some filtering and searching that you can do that might make it more what you want

Gil Philip Friend

> @Pete TY

> @Pete calendar is blank Sun-Weds every week

Pete Kaminski

> i should make and share an Obisidian page (aka Massive Wiki page) of the calls i know of

Jerry Michalski

> this Monica? https://bra.in/4jkXwZ

Pete Kaminski

> Massive Wiki is still only weakly social, but we have aspirations of getting lots better; FedWiki is more social right now, but perhaps even a little more arcane than MW.
