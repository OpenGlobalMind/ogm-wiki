      <h1>Foundation Followup Posts</h1>
<p>Great! Here are 15 YouTube short topics that would drive attention to your Design from Trust post:</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. <strong>"Why Wikipedia Shouldn't Work (But Does)"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The "expert review" model failed completely as Nupedia</li>
<li>Letting "any fool edit" was considered professional suicide</li>
<li>Now it's more accurate than Britannica and nobody talks about the vandals</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. <strong>"Your Bank Lied to You With Architecture"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Those Greek columns weren't about beauty—they were trust theater</li>
<li>The visible vault was saying "we're not running away with your money"</li>
<li>Now we design everything the same way: fake trust instead of real systems</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. <strong>"The Traffic Light Scam"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Dutch engineer removed all traffic signals and accidents plummeted</li>
<li>Turns out obeying signals makes you stupider and more dangerous</li>
<li>We've been building billion-dollar systems that make the problem worse</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. <strong>"Toyota's $1 Billion Trust Experiment"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Letting any worker stop the assembly line sounds insane</li>
<li>American manufacturers said it would destroy productivity</li>
<li>Instead it created the most efficient production system ever built</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. <strong>"Why Your Kids Are Dumber Than Unschooled Kids"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>We track, test, and control every moment of learning</li>
<li>Unschooled kids direct their own education with zero curriculum</li>
<li>Guess which ones end up more curious, creative, and employed?</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. <strong>"The Word That Broke Society"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>I spent a decade figuring out what one word did to us</li>
<li>"Consumer" turned citizens into passive receivers</li>
<li>Once you see it, you can't unsee how it infected everything</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. <strong>"Hospitals Saved 30% By Trusting Patients"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Default assumption: patients won't follow discharge instructions</li>
<li>Redesigned assuming patients WANT to be healthy but need help</li>
<li>Readmissions dropped 30%—just by flipping the assumption</li>
</ul>
<h2>8. <strong>"The Microfinance Heresy"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Banks: "Poor people can't be trusted with loans—no collateral!"</li>
<li>Muhammad Yunus: "What if we're wrong about that?"</li>
<li>Turns out the poorest borrowers have the highest repayment rates</li>
</ul>
<h2>9. <strong>"Why Control Is More Expensive Than Trust"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Surveillance, enforcement, compliance teams—insanely expensive</li>
<li>People spend MORE energy circumventing controls than working</li>
<li>Trust costs almost nothing and unlocks genius you didn't know you had</li>
</ul>
<h2>10. <strong>"The Unconference Trick Nobody Uses"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Most events: famous speakers, rigid schedule, zero interaction</li>
<li>Unconferences: show up, propose topics, go</li>
<li>The "unstructured chaos" creates the best conversations people have all year</li>
</ul>
<h2>11. <strong>"Your Job Description Is Hiding Your Genius"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>"Stay in your lane" = waste 80% of what you know</li>
<li>The best ideas come from people NOT doing their assigned role</li>
<li>We've designed trillion-dollar systems to prevent exactly this</li>
</ul>
<h2>12. <strong>"How to Turn Bad Actors Into Good Ones"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Most systems assume everyone's a potential criminal</li>
<li>Some "bad actors" just want to be heard or belong</li>
<li>Give them that and watch what happens (it's weirdly effective)</li>
</ul>
<h2>13. <strong>"The Scarcity = Abundance - Trust Formula"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Every scarcity you experience is probably artificial</li>
<li>Teacher shortage? Remove the PhD requirement, suddenly abundance</li>
<li>Most scarcity is just mistrust preventing access to existing abundance</li>
</ul>
<h2>14. <strong>"Why Workplace Democracy Terrifies Management"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>"Workers can't make strategic decisions!" (Why not?)</li>
<li>"They'll vote themselves raises!" (They don't)</li>
<li>Turns out people make BETTER decisions about work they actually do</li>
</ul>
<h2>15. <strong>"The One Question That Reveals Mistrust Design"</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Ask: "What does this system assume people will do wrong?"</li>
<li>Every security gate, permission slip, surveillance camera answers it</li>
<li>Once you start looking, you'll see we've designed EVERYTHING this way</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bonus hook for each video:</strong> End with "This is called Design from Trust, and once you see it, you can't unsee it. Link in bio."</p>
<p>These topics are designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead with a provocative contradiction</li>
<li>Challenge conventional wisdom with evidence</li>
<li>Leave people wanting the full framework (driving them to your post)</li>
<li>Work as 60-90 second shorts with high shareability</li>
</ul>
<p>The mischievous angle is baked into framing mainstream practices (traffic lights, job descriptions, school) as possibly wrong or even scams, while positioning contrarian approaches as obvious in hindsight.</p>
