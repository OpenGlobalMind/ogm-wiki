## Managing Call Artifacts Better

- how do we do manage call artifacts better?
	- more people than just jerry
	- automation?
		- ffmpeg
	- folders and destinations and sharing
		- youtube
		- cicolab
		- max?
		- stephan?
- adding a table of contents / time markers to youtube videos ([h/t Rob in Stewards mattermost](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/bu6w1mtcuifcurhkt68t3hczee))

## Launching Quest: Food Security and Regenerative Ag
calls:

issues:
- Pete: for OGM in general, do we need to reframe "OGM has clients" to "we are a team that is sorting out how to best organize itself"?
	- came up after first meeting
	- Klaus asked [let's just say we are a team that is sorting out how to best organize itself. Does that work?](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/x77ekkfrw7bfpbeeew8biibkny)
	- need to report back to Klaus
