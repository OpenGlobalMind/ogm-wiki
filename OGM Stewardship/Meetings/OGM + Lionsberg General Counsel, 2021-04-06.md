process so far
- alignment
- technical details
- legal details <-- you are here

goals
- rapidly, rapidly replicate model
- global movement
- sustainable prototypes
- structural (..) that lets it replicate
- stewardship
- preserve autonomy
- highlight interdependence
- pragmatically solve problems and demonstrate / model solutions
- learning community / finding answers
- prototype, learn, keep each other safe at each step
- strong pool of knowledge (an OGM core strength)
    - maybe annual conferences where we come together to share knowledge
- change culture
    - concerned about each other
    - concerned about sharing

structure
- organizations
- commons between organizatoins
    - what are the commons?
        - trusts
        - knowledge "seed banks"

directions / options
- fiscal sponsorship route - help OGM spin up an org that can be 
    - light, traditional path
    - puts OGM on the path to having its own non-profit status
    - fiscal sponsee has its own organization
- create fractal replication of the Lionsberg structure
    - create a branch, with fractal non-profit+for-profit (clone both)
    - fork + subsidiary that can be autonomous
    - subsidiary is immediately non-profit (instead of 9 months with IRS)
        - subsidiary owns a C corp
    - Delaware 501(c)3 + C corp
    - long-standing for generations; non-profit; tax cap
    - non-profit that is owner of a for-profit
    - Jordan's hypothesis: gets the same useful/valuable structure at a fraction of the time and cost
        - non-profit + C corp = basic fractal building block
    - quick replication, easier to administrate
    - allows for governing documents to be different at different fractal levels
    - for the fractal approach, we then start a 501(c)3 + a Delaware C Corp right away? plus a bank account for each?
        - in Californa and Delaware, a single person can be the director (sole member of the board) of a non-profit
        - a "board" is needed for legal reasons, but we want to evolve governance beyond that
            - "weight friends"
- subsidiary within Lionsberg (sort of fractal)
    - could be spun off
    - owning org would acknowledge up-front that subsidiary can spin out
    - HR, having employees
        - Lionsberg has HR infrastructure already
    - language of "subsidiary" creates some un-comfort
        - better: upside-down, tree trunk
        - maybe: aspen grove
        - would like to come up with better language
    - what does "sovereignty" really mean
        - ownership is a bundle of rights
        - [[fee simple absolute]] deed = "ownership", but actually doesn't capture ALL rights

Tree trunk + branches
- shared services in trunk
- some allocation from branches back to trunk to cover costs
- the more we have running in parallel, the better
    - ecosystem diversity
    - can afford better shared services
    - there are already lots of good niche orgs; a lot of it is just connecting

Good services to share
- legal
- governance
- HR

Non-profit
- solicitation registration required in 41 US states
    - non-profits are often not aware
    - includes even a "donate" button on a website or solicitation on Facebook
    - can costs 5-15k per registration
    - centralized donation with an entity 

Bill's explanation:
* sometimes non-profit gets into activities that are on the edge of the mission
* too much unrelated profit causes trouble
* vs. "pasture" non-profit (non-profit owns LLC); profit is imputed to non-profit; unanticipated unrelated tax liabilities
* C corp stops that; C corp can allocate profits as it wants, including donations
* C corp can employ people, and lease them to the non-profit
* provide a range of services to other orgs
* equity of C corp has perpetual interest that accrues to benefit of non-profit, not one or a few people
* no estate tax
* no one person owning everything and then selling it all
* all the non-profit values can be expressed in the for-profit world
    * demonstrates values to other for-profit companies

"C corps often don't pay taxes"
- the problem isn't the entity, it's that rich people avoid taxes however they can
- exploiting bugs in international relations
- another problem that isn't the entity is focus on short term profitability
- can do sharing and generosity, rather than extractive search for personal wealth

in sum:
- tax matters
- expression of values
- sustainability, generational, benefit to people

Q: how about a franchise model?
- values preserved by franchisor
- compatible with C corp
- "soft franchising"
    - could be licensing agreement
    - could include revenue sharing

Other Notes
- the Zeiss organization is a favorite example of [[steward ownership]]
- someone says "social franchising" for bottom-of-pyramid... https://www.dummies.com/business/start-a-business/3-types-franchising/
- the next chapter after "the nature of the firm" and "coase's penguin"
- nothing can be sustained without the social and moral values to sustain it
    - pure democracy = stupid mob can take over
- discernment by the “weighty quakers” - “sense of the meeting" - “weighty OGMers”
