### Pete's Project Management Headlines

- The most recently published version of the SoW (in the MoU) specifies a **lot** of work, in very general ways.  We will need more hands, better teamwork, and fine-grained specification of actionable outcomes before it is a [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) plan that I can sign off on.
- I believe there are prerequisites that need to be lined up before it makes sense to start the clock on the Launch Sprint. I suggest we have a "Prep Sprint" that is bound to yes/no checkoffs on prerequisites, rather than time, before we commit to starting the Launch Sprint.
- One of the primary prerequisites is enough committed hands and teamwork/coordination to do the work.  Hands may be volunteer or paid or a combination.  If paid, another prerequisite is money to pay them.
- Given our present minimal clarity around sprint velocity and effort estimation, I think a six-month Launch Sprint allows too much accumulated uncertainty in the out months for predictable delivery, and I recommend a shorter two- or three-month Launch Sprint instead.
