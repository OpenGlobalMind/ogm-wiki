# OGM Stewardship Jerry + Pete, 2021-03-28

## Agenda
- Discuss who/how many are quorum for which classes of decisions, for when we need to make definite decisions, potentially more frequently than once per week. (Bootstrap governance / Governance Plan)
- Start [[Communicating Lionsberg Process to OGM]] (to OGM members about OGM-Lionsberg).
- Start OGM Program/Project Management Tool Decision Plan (between Massive, Notion, Airtable, + whatever else).
- ~~Decide how/when to move most Stewardship operations back into the public channels rather than Inner Circle.~~
- Review need for other plans, such as Operational Plan for Launch Sprint.
- Discuss need for additional Stewardship meetings (like this one), and scheduling them better.
- Wrap the meeting and items above for presentation and review on Tuesday's meeting.
	- write up agenda for Tuesday's meeting
- Work (or not) on merging in MoU edits
- Project Mulligatawny (vs. lentil soup :-) 
	- [[Braneframe]]

## Bootstrap governance / Governance Plan
- Quorum for Classes of Decisions
	- sometimes we need decisions more frequently than once a week (or when we can convene everybody)
	- what's our bat signal? we need a way to make sure everybody in a quorum can be contacted swiftly
		- mattermost? email notifications? push notifications to mobile? etc.
		- email list?
	- what things can be done unilaterally? what things require agreement, and what level of agreement?
