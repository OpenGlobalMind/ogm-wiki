"Generative Commons Agreement"

[The Ethical Source Principles](https://bra.in/2vP7o9)

IP Stewardship Trust

should the commons be public domain? or copyrighted with a permissive license?

example: Vincent + Airtable + Massive + the Commons + making a living. our conversations operate under the Public Commons Conversations Agreement. and create that.

## Generative Commons Agreement

### Issues We're Monitoring
- enclosure of open source software by Microsoft
- likelihood of attach by capitalists and IP trolls
- possibility of eventual acquisition by capitalists
- how to making a living while nurturing Commons
	- doing well by doing good
- the world is in transition from enclosure to commons
- need for defensive patenting
- time-stamped disclosure
	- is disclosure enough?

### Intentions
- establishing a trust in the non-profit helps protect IP
- build on Creative Commons

## MOUs + Sovereigns

The New MOU has the important legal stuff, and you may be able to just start with that for your sovereign.

For Lionsberg agreements, the sovereigns really only need MOU + Appendices A & B. Appendix C is an OGM extra, since we have materials written for it; it's sort of an overflow for that. But it's not required for the agreement.

## Agenda

- Update on MOU drafting process - [Workspace: New MOU](https://hackmd.io/@peterkaminski/H1unImDwu/) (SWAG percentages are for OGM Bootstrap docs, which will serve as inspiration/templates for the other sovereigns)
    - (95%) New MOU
    - (99%) Appendix A: Slim, Fast Statement of Work
    - (99%) Appendix B: Cultures and Values Alignment
    - (95%) Appendix C: Larger, Evolving Vision Document
- "Closing the loop" on legal comments, questions, suggestions
    - tools, process, timing
- Discuss set of sovereigns
    - OGM Bootstrap
    - Massive
    - CICOLAB
    - Realigning Food Systems
    - Trove
- Discussing relative timing of sprints for sovereigns
    - OGM Bootstrap Sprint 1 = two months
