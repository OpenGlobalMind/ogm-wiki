# Lionsberg + OGM, 2021-05-13

## Check-ins

## MOU Review

### Questions

- can we shorten the two-week notice specified for fundraising?
- do sovereigns need to sync to the calendar? sync to each other?
- do sovereigns need to "act like non-profits"? what if they raise funds in a non-non-profit basis? what if they have for-profit component? what if they're non-US?
    - "impedance matching"
    - "emergent ideas that should/could be structured but are not yet"
- what's up with "steward **ownership**"?
    - resolved, let's just use stewardship

## Generative Commons

- Generative Commons Agreement
- IP trusts
- fractal "community marks"
