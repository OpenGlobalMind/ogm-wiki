# Template for Project (How to Use)
_see [[OGM Stewardship/Project Plans/Template for Project|Template for Project]] for actual template_

## Overview

Activities in an organization should be performed in the context of a "project." The project framework helps everyone -- participants and observers -- know what's going on, and why particular actions are being performed.

Creating a project plan helps ensure that participants understand all of the components necessary to complete the project successfully. A project plan is also a form of communication to others -- a way of asking if everything has been thought of, where there might be problems, what the expected outcome is.

In the wiki age, a project plan is not a static thing. It is expected to evolve over time as needed to track reality. It is a living document. The changes in the plan are visible to others, and form part of the narrative of progress as the project unfolds.

## Project Management Hygiene

-   set [SMART goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
-   understand tasks required to accomplish goals, then set realistic timeline
-   create project plan in wiki
-   regular, frequent check-ins to iterate plan (goal, priorities, etc.) if necessary
-   after-action reviews at the end of project, including reflection/writeup of positives and deltas
	-   see the [Agile Retrospective Resource Wiki](https://retrospectivewiki.org/) for ideas
-   experienced, well-oiled teams requires less strict project management hygiene
-   new, less-organized, or heterogenous teams require more attention to careful project management hygiene
