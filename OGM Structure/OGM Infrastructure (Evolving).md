        - Equitable distribution of available funds

- Set up simplest infrastructure for commercial ventures (eg, consulting, speaking)
- Lionsberg will provide $15K in matching funds for OGM. OGM will reach out to potential funders and raise the seed funds to match. 
- Sustainability: making concrete progress against our milestones and soliciting additional funders in the second half of the Sprint will enable OGM to pave a runway that continues from Sprint to Sprint.

    - Experiment with evaluating our progress

    - Define how independent sub-projects relate to one another within the community
    - Create process for supporting OGM members' own projects
    - Identify critical business structures and operations
    - Definition of done: Create a rubric for how we run experiments, and how we evaluate the results
    - Explore methods and tools for managing OGM activities

- Governance of OGM's emerging Commons
    - Experiment with defining our membrane (what protections we need around "open")    
    - Experiment with collective decision-making, using at least three processes, and create a report comparing them

- Governance dimensions
    - Experiment with connecting with other organizations
