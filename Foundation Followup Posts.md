**Bonus hook for each video:** End with "This is called Design from Trust, and once you see it, you can't unsee it. Link in bio."

These topics are designed to:

- Lead with a provocative contradiction
- Challenge conventional wisdom with evidence
- Leave people wanting the full framework (driving them to your post)
- Work as 60-90 second shorts with high shareability

The mischievous angle is baked into framing mainstream practices (traffic lights, job descriptions, school) as possibly wrong or even scams, while positioning contrarian approaches as obvious in hindsight.
