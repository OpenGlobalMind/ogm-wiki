# Quick First Book (QFB)

The [[Marley]] project's first goal is to co-author a book in the manner of an [Edited Volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edited_volume), built from Markdown files on Github repos. 

To achieve this, we need to:

- [ ] Choose the QFB's topic and title
- [ ] Find out who wants to contribute chapters
- [ ] Flesh out the [[Design Bible]] so we agree on what a Marley work looks like
- [ ] Design and assemble a [[Marley Publishing Infrastructure]] as part of the [[Marley Work Flow]]
- [ ]
