# Office Hours

Some of us are starting an experiment of having "office hours", regular times each week that you can come to talk with us about whatever.

Ping [Pete](mailto:kaminski@istori.com) if you'd like to set up your own office hours and have them included here.

Also see the [Plex Weekly Calendar](https://plex.collectivesensecommons.org/calendar/).
