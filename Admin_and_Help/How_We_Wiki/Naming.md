# Naming

[[Chunking]] breaks information into pieces of appropriately sized [[Modular Content]].

[[Naming]] is a way of finding and referring to a piece of [[Modular Content]]. 

This primarily happens at the level of the page. It can also happen at the levels of headers. 

As a team, we want to converge towards the similar names for similar concepts. 

This helps us continue to merge and chunk the [[Modular Content]] into a shared language.
