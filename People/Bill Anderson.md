# Bill Anderson

## What about me?
A retired data informatician (what does that mean?), sociotechnical (what? another big word?) computer systems engineer, and chemist. Also an open access advocate and inveterate punster.

When asked recently about what I value and my interests I responded with "Kindness, curiosity, honesty, and humor. I am interested in learning about, examining, and promoting abundance-based models and ideas of sustainable human societies."

I am also reviewing my childhood first-order learnings about how the world works.
